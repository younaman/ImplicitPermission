Prompt: As a Kubernetes expert, specializing in identifying API Sub-Resource reference and API Sub-Resource Permission Reference. Your task is to make the sub-resource reference analysis and sub-resource permission reference analysis.
Regarding the API Sub-Resource Reference analysis, it is defined as follows: In the context of Kubernetes, sub-resource reference analysis can be understood as analyzing the relationship between sub-resources and other resources. Below are some examples:
1. For pods/exec, creating pods/exec can execute commands in Pod, and secrets is mounted in pod, so there are the following resource reference: pods/exec --> secrets.
2. For pods/eviction, creating pods/eviction can expel the specified pod, so there are the following resource reference: pods/eviction --> pods.
3. For replicasets/scale, updating replicasets/scale can update the number of pods, so there are the following resource reference: replicasets/scale --> pods.
4. For nodes/status, updating nodes/status can update the status field of node, so there are the following resource reference: nodes/status --> nodes.
5. For statefulsets/scale, updating statefulsets/scale can update the number of pods, so there are the following resource reference: statefulsets/scale --> pods.
Regarding the API Sub-Resource Permission Reference analysis, it is defined as follows: In the context of Kubernetes, sub-resource permission reference analysis can be understood as analyzing how operations on sub-resources might affect other API resources or trigger operations on other API resources. Below are some examples:
1. For pod/exec, creating pods/exec can access the terminal session of a pod and access the contents of secrets mounted in the pod. Therefore, it can be concluded: create pods/exec --> get secrets.
2. For pods/eviction, creating pods/eviction can delete the specified pod. Therefore, it can be concluded: create pods/eviction --> delete pod.
3. For replicasets/scale, patching or updating replicasets/scale can adjust the number of Pods managed by the ReplicaSets, thereby increasing or decreasing the number of Pod resources. Therefore, it can be concluded: patch replicasets/scale --> create Pod, update replicasets/scale --> create Pod, patch replicasets/scale --> delete Pod, update replicasets/scale --> delete Pod.
4. For nodes/status, patching or updating nodes/status can affect the status of Nodes. Therefore, it can be concluded: patch nodes/status --> patch nodes, update nodes/status --> update nodes.
5. For statefulsets/scale, patching or updating statefulsets/scale can adjust the number of Pods managed by the StatefulSets, thereby increasing or decreasing the number of Pod resources. Therefore, it can be concluded: patch statefulsets/scale --> create Pod, update statefulsets/scale --> create Pod, patch statefulsets/scale --> delete Pod, update statefulsets/scale --> delete Pod.
Do you understand the above concepts, and are you ready to start the analysis? Answer yes or no.

Answer: 
Thinking...
Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants me to act as a Kubernetes expert analyzing API sub-resource references and their permission references. The examples given are helpful. Let me start by understanding each part.

First, the API Sub-Resource Reference analysis. It's about how a sub-resource relates to other resources. For example, pods/exec relates to secrets because secrets are mounted in the pod. So when you use pods/exec, you're interacting with secrets indirectly. Similarly, pods/eviction affects pods themselves.

Then there's the Permission Reference analysis. This looks at how operations on a sub-resource require or affect permissions on other resources. Like creating a pods/exec requires get access on secrets, since the pod might have mounted secrets that the exec could access.

I need to make sure I correctly identify both the resource relationships and the specific permissions involved. Let me think of another example. Maybe something like deployments/rollback. Rolling back a deployment would affect the replicasets and pods. So the resource reference would be deployments/rollback --> replicasets, and maybe pods. For permissions, rolling back might require update on deployments and maybe delete on replicasets or something. Not sure, but I need to check how exactly that works.

Another example could be podtemplates. If there's a podtemplate sub-resource, but I'm not sure. Maybe services/status. Updating services/status would affect the service resource itself. So the reference would be services/status --> services. Permission-wise, updating the status might require patch on services.

Wait, the examples given by the user use verbs like create, update, patch, delete. So for each sub-resource operation (like create pods/eviction), I have to see which verbs on the sub-resource lead to which verbs on other resources.

Another thing: when they mention "replicasets/scale" leads to create or delete pods, that's because scaling up creates pods, scaling down deletes them. So the same sub-resource operation can have different effects based on the direction. But the examples list both create and delete for patch and update. So maybe the permission is that updating scale could require both create and delete pod permissions, even though a single operation might only do one. Or perhaps it's that the scale operation could lead to either, so the permissions required are both.

I need to be careful to map the correct verbs. For example, when you update a replicasets/scale, the controller manager will create or delete pods as needed. So the actual permission needed by the user isn't directly creating pods, but the scale sub-resource update requires the RBAC to allow updating the scale, which in turn the controller uses its own privileges to create/delete pods. Wait, but in the examples, the user's action on the sub-resource implies that they need permissions that affect other resources. Or maybe it's that the sub-resource operation's effect requires the user to have permissions on those other resources. Wait, the examples given in permission reference seem to indicate that performing an operation on the sub-resource requires certain permissions on other resources. For example, creating pods/exec requires get on secrets. So if a user has permission to create pods/exec, they also need get on secrets to actually perform that action, because the exec can access the secrets mounted in the pod.

Similarly, creating pods/eviction requires delete on pods. Because evicting a pod is a way of deleting it, so the user needs delete permission on pods to create the eviction sub-resource.

So the analysis is about the required permissions for the user to perform the sub-resource operation, considering the effects it has. So when a user wants to perform an action on a sub-resource, they need not only permission on that sub-resource but also permission on the related resources that the sub-resource affects.

Therefore, for each sub-resource and operation (verb), I need to determine which other resources and verbs are required.

Let me test with another example. Suppose we have cronjobs/status. Updating cronjobs/status would affect the cronjob resource itself, so the reference would be cronjobs/status --> cronjobs. For permissions, updating the status would require patch on cronjobs, maybe.

Or take daemonsets/status. Similarly, updating daemonsets/status would reference daemonsets, and require patch daemonsets.

Another example: podsecuritypolicies. Wait, those are being deprecated. Maybe not. Let's think of something else.

How about roles/status in RBAC? Not sure. Maybe endpointslices in networking. Creating an endpointslices might relate to endpoints, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, consider deployments/scale. Similar to replicasets/scale, scaling a deployment would adjust the replicas, which in turn affects the underlying replicasets and pods. So the resource reference would be deployments/scale --> pods. Permission-wise, updating deployments/scale would require permissions that allow creating/deleting pods, but maybe through the deployment's controller. However, in the examples given, the user needs to have create and delete pod permissions directly. Wait, in the examples, the user's action on replicasets/scale requires create and delete pods, but in reality, when a user scales a replicaset, the actual pod creation is done by the controller, not the user. So why does the user need create pod permissions? Or maybe the example is considering that the user's action leads to pod changes, so the RBAC must account for that. But in Kubernetes, the user doesn't directly create pods when scaling; the controller does. Therefore, maybe the example is incorrect, or perhaps the analysis is from the perspective of required permissions on the user's part. For example, scaling a replicaset requires the user to have update access on replicasets/scale, but the controller's service account needs create/delete pods. However, the examples provided seem to link the user's permissions to the sub-resource's effects. So maybe the analysis is more about the effective permissions required rather than the direct permissions. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, looking back at the examples:

For replicasets/scale, the conclusion is that patch/update on scale leads to create/delete pods. So the user needs permissions to create and delete pods. But in reality, when a user scales a replicaset, the user only needs permissions on the scale sub-resource. The actual pod creation is handled by the replicaset controller, which has its own permissions. So perhaps the example is incorrect, or maybe the analysis is from a different perspective. Maybe it's about understanding that modifying scale affects pods, but the permission required for the user is just on the scale sub-resource. However, the given examples suggest that the user would need create and delete pod permissions, which doesn't align with my current understanding. This indicates that perhaps the permission reference is not about the user's RBAC permissions but the effect of the operation. Or maybe the analysis is considering the permissions that the Kubernetes API server enforces when processing the sub-resource request, which might involve checking related resources. Wait, but in the case of pods/exec, creating it requires get on secrets because the pod might have secrets mounted, and the API server checks if the user can access those secrets. So the API server does enforce that the user has get access on the secrets mounted by the pod when creating an exec sub-resource. That makes sense. So in that case, the permissions required for pods/exec include get on secrets. So it's about the permissions that the API server verifies when handling the sub-resource request, which might involve checking access to other resources referenced by the sub-resource.

Therefore, for each sub-resource operation, the API server may check permissions on other resources. For example, when you create a pods/eviction, the API server checks if the user has delete permission on the pod. Because evicting a pod is a form of deletion. So even though the user is creating an eviction sub-resource, the API server requires them to have delete permission on the pod itself.

Similarly, when you update a nodes/status, the API server requires the user to have patch permissions on the node resource. Because updating the status is part of the node object.

So the permission reference analysis is about mapping the operation on the sub-resource to the permissions that the API server enforces, which may include permissions on other resources.

Therefore, to perform the analysis correctly, I need to know for each sub-resource and verb, which other resources and verbs are required by the API server's admission control.

Given that, for example, when a user wants to create a pods/exec, the API server checks if they can get the pod, and also get any secrets that are mounted in the pod. So the permission reference would be create pods/exec --> get pods, get secrets.

But in the example given, the user only lists "create pods/exec --> get secrets". Maybe because the pod is the main resource, and the secrets are the additional ones. But perhaps the analysis here is focusing on the additional resources beyond the primary one.

Alternatively, maybe the analysis is that when you perform the operation on the sub-resource, it references another resource (like secrets) in addition to the main resource (pod). So the resource reference is pods/exec --> secrets, and the permission reference is create pods/exec --> get secrets.

So the main resource (pod) is implicit, and the analysis is about additional resources.

But I need to confirm based on the user's examples.

The user's first example for resource reference: pods/exec --> secrets. So even though pods/exec is a sub-resource of pods, the reference is to secrets, not pods. Then in the permission reference, it's create pods/exec --> get secrets. So maybe the pod is considered the parent resource, and the secrets are another resource that's referenced.

So perhaps the resource reference is the sub-resource pointing to other resources it affects or uses, and the permission reference is the required permissions on those other resources to perform the operation on the sub-resource.

Therefore, when analyzing a new sub-resource, I need to:

For resource reference: identify which other resources are affected or used by the sub-resource. For example, pods/exec uses secrets mounted in the pod, so the reference is to secrets.
For permission reference: determine which permissions on other resources are required to perform the operation on the sub-resource. For pods/exec, you need get on secrets.

So to proceed, I need to think of other sub-resources in Kubernetes and analyze them accordingly.

Let me think of some common sub-resources:

/status: Many resources have a status sub-resource (e.g., deployments/status, nodes/status). Updating status would reference the main resource.
/scale: As in deployments/scale, replicasets/scale, statefulsets/scale. These affect the number of replicas, which in turn affect pods.
/log: pods/log. Accessing logs might reference pods and possibly volumes or secrets if logs are stored there, but maybe not. Or maybe pods/log is just a sub-resource that allows reading logs, so the resource reference is pods/log --> pods. For permission, get pods/log would require get on pods.
/binding: pods/binding. Used to bind a pod to a node. Creating a binding would reference nodes.
/ephemeralcontainers: pods/ephemeralcontainers. Adding ephemeral containers to a pod. Would reference the pod and maybe images from secrets.
/portforward: pods/portforward. Similar to exec, might require access to the pod and any related network policies or services.
/proxy: services/proxy. Accessing the proxy sub-resource might reference endpoints or pods.
/approval: certificatesigningrequests/approval. Approving a CSR would reference the CSR itself and maybe certificates.

Let me pick a few of these and analyze.

First, pods/log: The sub-resource is pods/log. To get logs, you need to have access to the pod's logs. The resource reference would be pods/log --> pods, since it's part of the pod's data. The permission reference would be get pods/log --> get pods. Because to read logs, you need get permission on pods.

But according to the user's examples, if it's a direct sub-resource, maybe the resource reference isn't listed. But in the examples, nodes/status --> nodes is listed, so similar here, pods/log --> pods. But maybe the user is looking for references to other resources beyond the parent. For example, if the logs are stored in a volume that references a secret, then maybe pods/log --> secrets. But by default, pods/log just accesses the container logs via the kubelet, which doesn't involve secrets unless the log volume is backed by a secret. That might be too specific. So maybe pods/log only references pods.

Another example: pods/binding. Creating a pods/binding sub-resource allows binding a pod to a node. So the resource reference would be pods/binding --> nodes. Because you're binding the pod to a node. For permission reference, creating pods/binding would require update on pods (since it's changing the pod's node assignment) and maybe create on nodes? Or perhaps create on pods/binding requires update on pods and get on nodes. Wait, the actual permission required is create on pods/binding, but since it's part of the pod resource, maybe the RBAC is write on pods/binding. However, in terms of effect, binding a pod to a node would require that the node exists. So the API server might check that the node exists, but the user doesn't necessarily need permission on the node. So maybe the permission reference is create pods/binding --> update pods (since binding is part of the pod's spec). But according to Kubernetes docs, to create a binding, you need create on pods/binding, which is a separate permission. The actual effect is that the pod's nodeName is set, which is a field in the pod's spec. So maybe the permission reference is create pods/binding --> update pods. Because it's modifying the pod's spec. But I'm not sure. The user's example for nodes/status is patch nodes/status --> patch nodes, so similarly, create pods/binding would require update pods. But I need to verify.

Alternatively, the pods/binding sub-resource is a way to bind a pod to a node, which is typically done by the scheduler. The permission required is create on pods/binding, which is a separate verb. The API server, when processing the create on pods/binding, would check that the user has permission to create that sub-resource. The actual effect is that the pod's node assignment is set. So in terms of resource reference, it's pods/binding --> nodes. For permission reference, to create pods/binding, do you need any permissions on nodes? Probably not. Because the node is specified in the binding request, but the user needs to have permission to bind to that node. However, in standard Kubernetes, the nodes are cluster-scoped resources, and binding a pod to a node requires the user to have permissions on the pod and possibly the node. Wait, but in the case of the pods/binding sub-resource, the permission is create on pods/binding. The node is just a reference. The API server might check if the node exists but doesn't require the user to have permissions on the node. So maybe the permission reference is only create pods/binding, and the resource reference is pods/binding --> nodes. But the examples provided by the user seem to require that an action on a sub-resource leads to a permission on another resource. For instance, pods/eviction requires delete pod. So for pods/binding, creating it would require update pod (since it's modifying the pod's node assignment). Therefore, the permission reference would be create pods/binding --> update pod.

But according to Kubernetes RBAC, the verbs for sub-resources are separate. For example, to create a pods/binding, the RBAC rule would be verbs: ["create"], resources: ["pods/binding"]. So the user doesn't directly need update on pods, but creating the binding sub-resource implicitly allows modifying the pod's node assignment. However, the example for pods/eviction shows that creating pods/eviction requires delete pod. Which aligns with the idea that the eviction sub-resource's create verb requires the user to have delete permission on the pod. So similarly, creating pods/binding would require update permission on the pod. Therefore, the permission reference would be create pods/binding --> update pods.

Another example: certificatesigningrequests/approval. Approving a CSR involves updating the approval sub-resource. The resource reference would be certificatesigningrequests/approval --> certificatesigningrequests. For permission reference, updating the approval sub-resource would require update on certificatesigningrequests. Additionally, approving a CSR might trigger the creation of a certificate, which is stored in a secret. So the resource reference might also be certificatesigningrequests/approval --> secrets. The permission reference would be update certificatesigningrequests/approval --> create secrets, if the approval leads to a secret being created. But I'm not sure if that's the case. When a CSR is approved, the Kubernetes CA signs the certificate, and the signed certificate is updated in the CSR's status. The user then needs to read the CSR to get the certificate. If the certificate is then used in a secret, that's a separate step. So maybe the CSR approval itself doesn't create a secret, so the permission reference would only be update certificatesigningrequests/approval --> update certificatesigningrequests.

But this requires deeper knowledge of how CSRs work. Perhaps I should stick to simpler examples.

Let me try with the /proxy sub-resource. For example, creating a proxy sub-resource for a service: services/proxy. Accessing this might allow proxying requests to the service's endpoints. The resource reference would be services/proxy --> services, endpoints, pods. Because proxying a service routes to endpoints, which are pods. For permission reference, accessing services/proxy would require get on services, get on endpoints, and maybe get on pods. But I'm not sure. The actual permissions needed might be get on services/proxy, which is a sub-resource, and the API server would check access to the service. Proxying might not directly require access to endpoints or pods, as that's handled by the kube-proxy. So maybe the resource reference is services/proxy --> services, and the permission reference is get services/proxy --> get services.

But the user's examples for pods/exec have a reference to secrets, which are mounted in the pod. So perhaps if a service's proxy relies on endpoints that reference pods with certain secrets, then services/proxy might indirectly reference secrets. But that's probably stretching it. More likely, the main resource is the service itself.

This is getting complicated, and I need to be careful not to make incorrect assumptions. Let's try to outline steps for analysis:

Identify the sub-resource and its parent resource.
Determine what other resources are affected or utilized when interacting with this sub-resource.
For resource reference, list the sub-resource --> other resources.
For permission reference, determine which operations on the sub-resource require which permissions on other resources, based on what the API server enforces.

Given that, let's try to analyze a new sub-resource: deployments/rollback.

The deployments/rollback sub-resource allows rolling back to a previous revision. When you perform a rollback, it affects the deployment's template, which in turn triggers a new replicaset and pod changes.

Resource reference: deployments/rollback --> deployments, replicasets, pods. But according to the user's examples, the references seem to be direct. For example, pods/eviction --> pods. So maybe deployments/rollback --> deployments, replicasets. Or maybe just deployments/rollback --> deployments, since the rollback modifies the deployment's spec, which then affects replicasets and pods indirectly. But the user's examples for scale reference pods directly, so perhaps deployments/rollback would reference replicasets, as the rollback changes which replicaset is scaled.

Permission reference: To perform a rollback, you need to update the deployments/rollback sub-resource. The API server would check that the user has update permission on deployments/rollback. But in terms of effects, rolling back a deployment would cause the deployment controller to create a new replicaset and scale down the old one. Therefore, the user needs permission to update deployments/rollback, and the controller needs permission to manage replicasets and pods. However, according to the user's examples, the permission reference is about the user's required permissions. So in this case, since the rollback affects replicasets, maybe the user needs permissions on replicasets. But in reality, the user only needs permissions on the deployments/rollback sub-resource, and the controller handles the rest. Therefore, maybe there's no direct permission reference beyond the sub-resource itself. But according to the user's examples, replicasets/scale requires permissions on pods, which are managed by the controller. So perhaps the analysis assumes that the user's action on the sub-resource implies they need permissions on the affected resources, even if the controller is the one performing the actions.

This is conflicting because in Kubernetes, users don't need permissions on pods to scale a replicaset; they just need permissions on the scale sub-resource. The controller's service account has permissions to manage pods. But the user's examples indicate that scaling replicasets/scale requires create and delete pods. So perhaps the analysis is from the perspective of the overall system's permissions, not the user's RBAC. Or maybe it's a conceptual model rather than actual RBAC requirements.

This is a bit confusing. To adhere to the examples provided, I have to follow their pattern. For example, in the replicasets/scale example, even though the user doesn't directly create/delete pods, the analysis says that updating the scale requires those permissions. So perhaps the analysis is about the transitive effect: when you update the scale, it causes pods to be created/deleted, so conceptually, the permission reference includes those operations. But in reality, the user doesn't need those permissions. This discrepancy suggests that the examples might be simplifying or abstracting the actual permissions.

In that case, to align with the examples, even if it's not technically accurate in terms of RBAC, I should follow the given pattern. Therefore, when a sub-resource operation leads to a change in another resource, list those as permission references.

So for rollback:

Resource reference: deployments/rollback --> replicasets (because rolling back changes which replicaset is active).
Permission reference: update deployments/rollback --> create replicasets, delete replicasets (if old ones are scaled down), create pods, delete pods.

But the user's examples for scale have both create and delete pods. Similarly, rollback would trigger new replicasets and pods (create) and scale down old ones (delete). So the permission reference would include create and delete on replicasets and pods.

But this seems inconsistent with how Kubernetes RBAC works. However, following the user's examples, this would be the approach.

Alternatively, maybe the analysis is about the controller's permissions. For example, when a user updates a deployment's rollback, the deployment controller needs permissions to manage replicasets and pods. But the user's own permissions don't include those. So perhaps the permission reference in the examples is not about the user's RBAC but the controller's, but that doesn't align with the examples given.

Given the confusion, I think I need to proceed by mimicking the pattern in the examples, even if it doesn't perfectly align with actual Kubernetes RBAC mechanics. So for each sub-resource operation, if performing that operation leads to a change in another resource, then the permission reference is the verb on the sub-resource leading to the corresponding verb on the other resource.

Another example: daemonsets/status. Updating daemonsets/status affects the daemonset's status. So resource reference: daemonsets/status --> daemonsets. Permission reference: patch daemonsets/status --> patch daemonsets.

For pods/portforward: The sub-resource is pods/portforward. Creating this allows forwarding ports to the pod. Similar to exec, if the pod has volumes mounted from secrets, then the resource reference would be pods/portforward --> secrets. Permission reference: create pods/portforward --> get secrets.

But port forwarding itself doesn't necessarily access the secrets unless the pod's configuration requires it. However, like exec, the API server might check permissions on any volumes mounted, especially if they involve secrets. So if a pod has a secret volume, creating a portforward might require get access to those secrets, similar to exec.

This is quite involved. I think the key is to follow the examples provided by the user, even if it means making some assumptions about how permissions are checked. The main task is to identify relationships and required permissions as per the given patterns.

In summary, for each sub-resource:

Identify which other resources it references (Resource Reference).
Determine which permissions on other resources are required when performing operations on the sub-resource (Permission Reference).

I need to apply this logic to any given sub-resource based on the user's examples.
Yes. I'm ready to perform the analysis based on the provided definitions and examples. Please provide the specific Kubernetes sub-resource(s) or scenarios you want to analyze for API Sub-Resource Reference and API Sub-Resource Permission Reference.

Prompt: Please make the API Sub-Resource Reference analysis of cronjobs/status. Just list the final results such as 'cronjobs/status --> otherRes', without explanation.

Answer: 
Thinking...
Alright, the user is asking for the API Sub-Resource Reference analysis of cronjobs/status. Let me recall the examples given earlier.

In the examples, like nodes/status --> nodes, the pattern was that the sub-resource status directly relates to its parent resource. So updating cronjobs/status would affect the cronjob itself. Hence, the resource reference should be cronjobs/status --> cronjobs. That matches the structure of other status sub-resources. There's no need to involve other resources beyond the parent here since the status is part of the cronjob resource. Just follow the established pattern.
cronjobs/status --> cronjobs

Prompt: Review your answer against the initial definitions:  
1. Did you avoid introducing unrelated resources?
Answer "Pass" if compliant, or "Fail: [reason]" if not.
If the answer is fail, please correct the result.

Answer: 
Thinking...
Alright, let's check if my answer meets the user's requirements. The user provided an initial definition where sub-resource reference analysis connects a sub-resource to related resources. The example given was nodes/status --> nodes.

For cronjobs/status, I concluded cronjobs/status --> cronjobs. The cronjobs/status sub-resource directly relates to the cronjobs resource itself, similar to how nodes/status relates to nodes.

I didn't include any other resources like jobs or pods, which cronjobs might manage. The user's initial examples only linked the sub-resource to its parent resource, not downstream resources. Since cronjobs/status is part of the cronjob object, it correctly references cronjobs without introducing unrelated resources.

Therefore, my answer adheres to the guidelines. Passing.
Pass

Prompt: The verbs supported by cronjobs/status resource include: [Get Update Patch]
Based on the verb obtained above, please make the subresource permission reference analysis of cronjobs/status. Just list the results of permission reference, such as 'verb cronjobs/status --> create B', without explanation.

Answer: 
Thinking...
Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to perform a subresource permission reference analysis for cronjobs/status using the verbs Get, Update, and Patch.

First, looking back at the examples provided earlier. For nodes/status, the permission references were patch nodes/status --> patch nodes and update nodes/status --> update nodes. That's because modifying the status sub-resource directly affects the main resource's status field. So applying that pattern here, updating or patching cronjobs/status would require the same verbs on the cronjobs resource itself.

The verbs supported are Get, Update, Patch. For Get, since reading the status is part of the cronjob resource, getting cronjobs/status would require get access on cronjobs. For Update and Patch, similar to nodes/status, these would translate to update and patch permissions on the main cronjobs resource.

I need to make sure not to introduce any unrelated resources. Since cronjobs/status directly relates to cronjobs, the permissions should only reference cronjobs. No need to involve jobs or pods here, as the examples didn't do that for similar status sub-resources.
get cronjobs/status --> get cronjobs
update cronjobs/status --> update cronjobs
patch cronjobs/status --> patch cronjobs

Prompt: Review your answer against the initial definitions:
1. Did you avoid introducing unrelated permission references?
