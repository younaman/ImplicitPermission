Prompt: As a Kubernetes expert, specializing in identifying API Sub-Resource reference and API Sub-Resource Permission Reference. Your task is to make the sub-resource reference analysis and sub-resource permission reference analysis.
Regarding the API Sub-Resource Reference analysis, it is defined as follows: In the context of Kubernetes, sub-resource reference analysis can be understood as analyzing the relationship between sub-resources and other resources. Below are some examples:
1. For pods/exec, creating pods/exec can execute commands in Pod, and secrets is mounted in pod, so there are the following resource reference: pods/exec --> secrets.
2. For pods/eviction, creating pods/eviction can expel the specified pod, so there are the following resource reference: pods/eviction --> pods.
3. For replicasets/scale, updating replicasets/scale can update the number of pods, so there are the following resource reference: replicasets/scale --> pods.
4. For nodes/status, updating nodes/status can update the status field of node, so there are the following resource reference: nodes/status --> nodes.
5. For statefulsets/scale, updating statefulsets/scale can update the number of pods, so there are the following resource reference: statefulsets/scale --> pods.
Regarding the API Sub-Resource Permission Reference analysis, it is defined as follows: In the context of Kubernetes, sub-resource permission reference analysis can be understood as analyzing how operations on sub-resources might affect other API resources or trigger operations on other API resources. Below are some examples:
1. For pod/exec, creating pods/exec can access the terminal session of a pod and access the contents of secrets mounted in the pod. Therefore, it can be concluded: create pods/exec --> get secrets.
2. For pods/eviction, creating pods/eviction can delete the specified pod. Therefore, it can be concluded: create pods/eviction --> delete pod.
3. For replicasets/scale, patching or updating replicasets/scale can adjust the number of Pods managed by the ReplicaSets, thereby increasing or decreasing the number of Pod resources. Therefore, it can be concluded: patch replicasets/scale --> create Pod, update replicasets/scale --> create Pod, patch replicasets/scale --> delete Pod, update replicasets/scale --> delete Pod.
4. For nodes/status, patching or updating nodes/status can affect the status of Nodes. Therefore, it can be concluded: patch nodes/status --> patch nodes, update nodes/status --> update nodes.
5. For statefulsets/scale, patching or updating statefulsets/scale can adjust the number of Pods managed by the StatefulSets, thereby increasing or decreasing the number of Pod resources. Therefore, it can be concluded: patch statefulsets/scale --> create Pod, update statefulsets/scale --> create Pod, patch statefulsets/scale --> delete Pod, update statefulsets/scale --> delete Pod.
Do you understand the above concepts, and are you ready to start the analysis? Answer yes or no.

Answer: 
Thinking...
Okay, let's see. The user wants me to act as a Kubernetes expert focusing on API sub-resource references and their permission references. The examples provided earlier show how certain sub-resources relate to other resources and the permissions involved.

First, I need to make sure I understand the difference between the two analyses. The Sub-Resource Reference analysis is about the direct relationship between a sub-resource and another resource. For example, pods/exec relates to secrets because secrets are mounted in the pod. So, the reference is from the sub-resource to the other resource.

Then, the Permission Reference analysis is about how operations on the sub-resource affect other API resources. For instance, creating a pods/eviction leads to deleting a pod. So, the permission required here is the delete action on pods.

When presented with a new sub-resource, I need to determine both its resource references and the corresponding permission references. Let's say the user gives me a new sub-resource like deployments/status. For the resource reference, updating deployments/status would affect the deployment's status, so the reference would be deployments/status --> deployments. For permissions, updating deployments/status might require patch or update permissions on deployments themselves. So, the permission reference would be something like update deployments/status --> update deployments.

Another example could be cronjobs/status. The resource reference would link cronjobs/status to cronjobs. The permission reference would tie updating cronjobs/status to patching cronjobs.

I need to be careful to check the Kubernetes API documentation for each sub-resource to confirm these relationships. Some sub-resources might have indirect effects. For example, scaling a deployment (deployments/scale) affects the replica count, which in turn affects pods. So, deployments/scale --> replicasets (if using ReplicaSets) and then replicasets/scale --> pods. But according to the examples given earlier, the direct reference is from the scale sub-resource to pods. Wait, in the examples, replicasets/scale is directly linked to pods. So maybe I should follow that pattern and link deployments/scale directly to pods as well, since scaling a deployment changes the number of pods.

But need to verify. Deployments manage ReplicaSets, which in turn manage Pods. So scaling a deployment updates the ReplicaSet's desired replicas, leading to Pods being created or terminated. So the direct resource reference for deployments/scale would be deployments/scale --> pods. Similarly, the permission reference would be that updating deployments/scale requires create and delete permissions on pods.

Wait, but in the examples given, replicasets/scale is linked directly to pods. So I should model deployments/scale similarly. So the resource reference would be deployments/scale --> pods. The permission reference would be that updating or patching deployments/scale would require create and delete pod permissions.

But maybe I need to check if there's an intermediate step. For instance, when you scale a deployment, it creates a new ReplicaSet with the updated replica count, and the old ReplicaSet is scaled down. So the actual pod creation/deletion is handled by the ReplicaSet's scale sub-resource. So maybe the deployments/scale affects ReplicaSets, which then affect Pods. However, according to the examples, the scale sub-resources directly reference pods, not the intermediate resources. So perhaps the correct approach here is to follow the examples and link scale sub-resources to pods directly, even if there's an intermediary in the control flow.

Therefore, for any scale sub-resource (like deployments/scale, statefulsets/scale, replicasets/scale), the resource reference is to pods. The permission references would require create and delete on pods for update/patch operations on the scale sub-resource.

Another example could be daemonsets/status. Updating daemonsets/status would reference daemonsets themselves. The permission reference would link updating daemonsets/status to patching daemonsets.

Let me think about another sub-resource: pods/log. Accessing pods/log allows reading the logs of a container, which is part of the pod. So the resource reference would be pods/log --> pods. For permissions, getting pods/log would require get permission on pods, since you need to access the pod's log. So the permission reference would be get pods/log --> get pods.

Another one: pods/portforward. Creating a portforward sub-resource allows forwarding ports to the pod. The resource reference would be pods/portforward --> pods. The permission reference would be create pods/portforward --> get pods, maybe? Or does it require update? Wait, the example for pods/exec was create pods/exec --> get secrets. Because the pod might have mounted secrets, so to create an exec session, you need access to the secrets. For portforward, maybe it's similar. To port forward into a pod, you need access to the pod, so the permission reference would be create pods/portforward --> get pods. Because you need to retrieve the pod's details to set up the port forward.

But I need to check if there's more. If the pod has volumes mounted from secrets, does portforward require access to secrets? Maybe not, unless the port forward operation somehow involves accessing the secrets. Since port forwarding is about network traffic, not about the filesystem, maybe it's just the pod. So the permission would be create pods/portforward --> get pods.

Another example: services/status. Updating services/status affects the service's status. So the resource reference is services/status --> services. Permission reference would be patch services/status --> patch services.

Wait, in the nodes/status example, updating nodes/status --> update nodes. But nodes/status is a sub-resource that's part of the node's status field. So maybe when you update nodes/status, it's equivalent to patching the node's status subresource, which in the API is a different permission. However, in the permission reference example given, it's concluded that updating nodes/status requires patch nodes or update nodes. So perhaps the same applies here: updating or patching services/status would require patch services.

But I need to be careful. Kubernetes API has separate verbs for different sub-resources. For example, to update the status sub-resource, you might need update permission on the status sub-resource. However, when you update the status, it might implicitly require permission on the main resource. Or maybe the example is simplifying it.

In the given examples, for nodes/status, the conclusion was patch nodes/status --> patch nodes. So the permission reference links the sub-resource operation to the main resource's operation. Therefore, for services/status, updating services/status would require update services.

But I need to confirm. For example, when you perform an update on a sub-resource like status, the API server may require that you have permissions on the main resource. For instance, to update pods/status, you need update permission on pods/status, but the example shows nodes/status's update requires update nodes. So perhaps the permission is mapped directly. Hence, the permission reference would be that updating a sub-resource like services/status requires update on the main resource services.

So in general, for status sub-resources, the permission reference would link the operation on the sub-resource (e.g., update services/status) to the same operation on the main resource (update services). But perhaps in reality, the RBAC for sub-resources is separate. For example, you might have a role that grants update on services/status, which is a different permission than update on services. However, the examples provided by the user seem to link them. For instance, nodes/status's permission reference is patch nodes/status --> patch nodes. So according to that, the operation on the sub-resource's permission is linked to the same verb on the main resource.

That might be because when you, for example, update a sub-resource like status, it's considered as updating the main resource's status field. Hence, the required permission is the same as updating the main resource. But I'm not entirely sure. The user's examples are likely simplifying for the purpose of the analysis, so I should follow their pattern.

So, for services/status, the permission reference would be patch services/status --> patch services, update services/status --> update services.

Another example: roles/bindings. Wait, no, roles and rolebindings are separate resources. Maybe considering clusterroles/bindings. But maybe that's not a sub-resource. Wait, in Kubernetes, the bindings are separate resources (RoleBinding, ClusterRoleBinding), not sub-resources of roles. So perhaps not applicable.

Let me think of another sub-resource. How about leases in the coordination.k8s.io API group. Leases have a status sub-resource? Or maybe not. Let's say we have leases/status. If updating leases/status affects the lease's status, the resource reference would be leases/status --> leases. Permission reference would be update leases/status --> update leases.

Another example could be ingresses/status. Similar to services/status. So resource reference: ingresses/status --> ingresses. Permission reference: update ingresses/status --> update ingresses.

I should also consider other verbs. For example, get access on a sub-resource. Like get pods/log. That would require get permission on pods/log, but according to the user's examples, maybe this translates to get pods. So the permission reference would be get pods/log --> get pods. Because to read the logs, you need access to the pod.

Wait, in the pods/exec example, creating pods/exec requires get secrets, because the pod has mounted secrets. So perhaps for pods/log, getting the logs requires get pods, since the logs are part of the pod's data. So the permission reference would be get pods/log --> get pods.

But maybe if the logs are stored elsewhere, but in Kubernetes, logs are part of the pod's sub-resource. So getting pods/log requires get on pods/log, but the example might consider that having get on pods is required. However, RBAC in Kubernetes differentiates between resources and sub-resources. For example, to allow a user to get logs, you need to grant them get on pods/log. But the user's examples might be simplifying this. For instance, in the pods/exec example, the required permission is get secrets, which is a separate resource. So maybe the permissions needed for the sub-resource operation can involve other resources, not just the main resource.

Therefore, for pods/log, the permission reference might be get pods/log --> get pods. Because you need access to the pod to get its logs, but you also need permission on the pods/log sub-resource. But according to the user's examples, the analysis links the sub-resource operation to permissions on other resources. For pods/exec, creating it requires get secrets because secrets are mounted. So, for pods/log, maybe it's just get pods, unless the logs are stored in a different resource, which they aren't. So the permission reference would be get pods/log --> get pods.

But the actual RBAC rule would require get on pods/log. However, the user's analysis seems to abstract this. Wait, looking back at the examples:

For pod/exec, creating pods/exec requires get secrets. The reasoning is that the pod has secrets mounted, so accessing the pod's exec might require accessing the secrets. Therefore, the permission reference is create pods/exec --> get secrets.

Similarly, in pods/log, maybe it's just get pods, unless the logs are stored in some other resource. So if a user can create pods/exec, they can execute into the pod and access secrets, hence needing get secrets. For pods/log, to get the logs, you need to access the pod's log sub-resource, but the pod's log data is part of the pod's runtime, so the permission is get pods. But according to Kubernetes RBAC, the actual permission required is get on pods/log. But the user's examples might be considering that higher-level effect. For example, even though technically you need get on pods/log, the analysis might link it to get pods because the log is part of the pod. But the examples provided don't have a case like this.

Alternatively, perhaps the user's examples are more focused on how the sub-resource operation affects other resources (like creating pods/eviction deletes pods) rather than the direct RBAC permissions. So in the case of pods/eviction, creating it requires delete pods permission. Even though the actual RBAC rule would be create on pods/eviction, the analysis infers that this operation effectively requires delete on pods.

But according to the example, creating pods/eviction requires delete pod permission, which is a separate resource. So the permission reference is about the required permissions on other resources, not the sub-resource itself. Ah, this is an important distinction. So the analysis is not about the RBAC permissions needed on the sub-resource, but the permissions needed on other resources as a result of the operation on the sub-resource.

Wait, the user's definition says: "how operations on sub-resources might affect other API resources or trigger operations on other API resources." So when you perform an operation on a sub-resource, it might require permissions on other resources, or it might trigger operations on other resources which in turn require certain permissions.

So for example, when you create a pods/eviction, the API server will evict the pod, which is equivalent to deleting it. Therefore, to perform this operation, the user must have delete permission on pods. Even though the RBAC rule might be create on pods/eviction, the effective permission needed is delete pods. Hence, the permission reference is create pods/eviction --> delete pods.

Similarly, when you update a replicasets/scale, the ReplicaSet controller will create or delete pods. Therefore, the user needs permissions to create and delete pods, even though the RBAC rule is update on replicasets/scale.

Therefore, the permission reference analysis is about the effective permissions required on other resources when performing an operation on a sub-resource. Not the direct RBAC permissions on the sub-resource itself.

This is crucial. So for example, if a user has permission to update replicasets/scale but does not have permission to create pods, then the scale operation would fail because the ReplicaSet controller (which is part of the system) needs to create pods, but the user themselves don't have that permission. Wait, but in Kubernetes, the controller manager runs with high privileges, so the user's permissions don't directly affect the controller's ability to create pods. So maybe the permission reference here is different.

Wait, maybe the examples provided are considering that the act of scaling a ReplicaSet will result in pod creations/deletions, and therefore, the user must have permissions to create and delete pods in order for the scale operation to be allowed. But that's not how Kubernetes works. The user's permissions are checked against the sub-resource operation (e.g., update replicasets/scale), and the controller's permissions (which are typically cluster-admin) handle the actual pod creation/deletion. So the user doesn't need pod create/delete permissions themselves.

Hmm, this is conflicting with the examples provided. Let me re-examine the examples:

The example given for replicasets/scale states that patching or updating replicasets/scale can adjust the number of Pods, so the permission references are create and delete Pods. But according to Kubernetes RBAC, the user only needs permissions on the replicasets/scale sub-resource. The actual creation/deletion of pods is done by the ReplicaSet controller, which has its own permissions.

Therefore, maybe the user's examples are incorrect, or perhaps there's a misunderstanding. However, since the user provided those examples, I need to follow their logic for consistency.

In the user's examples, the permission references are indicating that the operation on the sub-resource requires permissions on other resources. For example, updating replicasets/scale requires create and delete Pod permissions. This might be a way to model the cascading effects: if a user can scale a ReplicaSet, they indirectly can create and delete Pods. Therefore, from a security perspective, granting scale permissions effectively grants pod creation/deletion. Hence, in terms of required permissions, the user must have both scale permissions and pod create/delete, or the example is abstracting that the scale permission implies needing pod create/delete.

But that's not accurate in Kubernetes. The user can be granted the scale permission without pod create/delete, and the ReplicaSet controller (with higher privileges) handles the pod changes. However, if the user's analysis is considering that allowing scale indirectly allows affecting pods, then the permission reference would link scale operations to pod create/delete, even if the user doesn't directly need those permissions.

Therefore, following the user's examples, even if technically the user doesn't need pod permissions, the analysis is modeling the effect of the operation. So for replicasets/scale, updating it leads to pod changes, hence requiring create/delete pod permissions. Even though in reality the user doesn't need those, the analysis is based on the outcome.

This seems to be the case in the examples provided. For instance, pods/eviction's permission reference is delete pod. Because creating pods/eviction results in the pod being deleted. Therefore, the analysis links the sub-resource operation to the effective permission required to cause that outcome, even if the actual RBAC is different.

So, with that understanding, the permission reference analysis is about the effective permissions that would be required to achieve the outcome of the sub-resource operation, regardless of the actual RBAC rules. It's a way to model the implications of allowing a user to perform an operation on a sub-resource.

Therefore, when performing the analysis, I need to think: what permissions would a user need to have to cause the same effect through direct operations on other resources? For example, if creating a pods/eviction results in a pod being deleted, then the user would need delete pod permission to achieve the same effect. Hence, the permission reference is create pods/eviction --> delete pod.

Similarly, scaling a ReplicaSet changes the number of pods. To do that directly, the user would need to update the ReplicaSet's replicas. But if they use the scale sub-resource, they need update on replicasets/scale. However, the analysis is linking the scale operation to pod create/delete permissions because that's the effect.

So, following this logic, whenever a sub-resource operation results in a change to another resource, the permission reference is the operation on the sub-resource leading to the verb on the affected resource.

Therefore, when presented with a new sub-resource, I need to:

Determine which other resources are affected when this sub-resource is operated upon.
For each operation on the sub-resource (create, update, patch, delete, etc.), determine which operations on other resources are effectively being performed.
Map the sub-resource operation to those other resource operations.

For example, if we consider the sub-resource deployments/rollback (assuming such a sub-resource exists), rolling back a deployment would revert to a previous ReplicaSet. This could involve scaling down the current ReplicaSet and scaling up the previous one. Therefore, the resource reference would be deployments/rollback --> replicasets, pods. The permission reference for creating a rollback might require update deployments, update replicasets, and create/delete pods. But I need to check if that's the case.

Alternatively, if the deployments/rollback sub-resource is part of the extensions/v1beta1 API, which it was in older versions, the rollback operation would update the deployment's configuration to a previous revision. This might not directly reference replicasets or pods, but in effect, it triggers the deployment controller to adjust ReplicaSets and pods. Following the user's examples, the permission reference might link to pods create/delete, similar to scaling.

But since the user's examples for scale sub-resources link directly to pods, even though the actual intermediate is ReplicaSets, I should follow that pattern and link deployments/rollback --> pods for resource reference, and the permission reference would be patch deployments/rollback --> create Pod, delete Pod, etc.

However, I need to be cautious and perhaps stick to direct relationships. Maybe the resource reference for deployments/rollback would be deployments/rollback --> deployments, as it's rolling back the deployment itself. The permission reference would be patch deployments/rollback --> update deployments, because rolling back modifies the deployment's spec.

But according to the user's example for replicasets/scale, even though scaling affects pods through ReplicaSets, the resource reference is directly to pods. So perhaps any sub-resource that ultimately affects pods should reference pods, even indirectly.

This is a bit ambiguous. To adhere to the examples, I need to see how they structured it. For instance, replicasets/scale directly references pods, even though the scale is a property of the ReplicaSet. So the resource reference is made directly to pods, not to the ReplicaSet. Similarly, pods/eviction references pods, not something else.

Therefore, the rule seems to be: if the sub-resource operation's main effect is on another resource, reference that resource. For example, evicting a pod (pods/eviction) directly deletes the pod, so the reference is pods/eviction --> pods. Scaling a ReplicaSet (replicasets/scale) changes the number of pods, so the reference is replicasets/scale --> pods.

Therefore, for a deployment's scale sub-resource (deployments/scale), the resource reference would be deployments/scale --> pods, since scaling a deployment changes the number of pods. The permission reference would be that updating deployments/scale requires create and delete pods, similar to the ReplicaSet example.

Another example: jobs/status. Updating jobs/status would affect the job's status, so the resource reference is jobs/status --> jobs. The permission reference would be patch jobs/status --> patch jobs.

Wait, according to the nodes/status example, updating nodes/status requires patch nodes. So for jobs/status, updating it would require patch jobs.

Now, let's consider a new sub-resource: persistentvolumeclaims/status. The resource reference would be persistentvolumeclaims/status --> persistentvolumeclaims. The permission reference would be patch persistentvolumeclaims/status --> patch persistentvolumeclaims.

Alternatively, if updating the status of a PVC affects the bound persistent volume, maybe there's a reference to persistentvolumes. But according to the examples, we should only reference the direct resource. Since the PVC's status is part of the PVC itself, the reference is to PVCs.

Another example: podtemplates. Wait, podtemplates are a separate resource, not a sub-resource. Maybe considering something like replicationcontrollers/scale. Similar to replicasets/scale, scaling an RC affects the number of pods. So resource reference replicationcontrollers/scale --> pods. Permission reference: update replicationcontrollers/scale --> create Pod, delete Pod.

In summary, the approach should be:

For each sub-resource, identify the primary resource it affects directly.
For the permission reference, determine which operations on other resources are effectively allowed by having access to the sub-resource operation.

Now, if the user provides a new sub-resource, I should follow the pattern set by the examples. Let's say they ask about leases/status. The resource reference would be leases/status --> leases. Permission reference: patch leases/status --> patch leases.

Another example: certificatesigningrequests/approval. Approving a CSR (certificatesigningrequests/approval) updates its status, so the resource reference is certificatesigningrequests/approval --> certificatesigningrequests. The permission reference would be update certificatesigningrequests/approval --> update certificatesigningrequests. Additionally, approving a CSR might lead to creating a certificate, so maybe certificatesigningrequests/approval --> certificates. But the examples don't seem to include indirect resource references; they focus on direct effects. Therefore, it would stick to certificatesigningrequests.

However, if approving a CSR results in a secret being created (as the signed certificate is stored in a secret), then the resource reference would be certificatesigningrequests/approval --> secrets. But that depends on the specific flow. Unless the user's examples include such indirect effects, I should avoid assuming them unless it's explicit.

In the given examples, pods/exec references secrets because secrets are mounted in the pod, so the exec operation can access them. That's a direct enough relationship. Similarly, evicting a pod directly deletes it. So I need to ensure that the resource references are only for direct effects.

Therefore, for certificatesigningrequests/approval, the direct effect is on the CSR itself, so the resource reference would be to certificatesigningrequests. The permission reference would be update certificatesigningrequests/approval --> update certificatesigningrequests.

But if the approval leads to a secret being created, that's part of the certificatesigningrequest's processing, but not directly tied to the sub-resource operation. Hence, it's not included.

This requires careful consideration. In the user's examples, replicasets/scale affects pods, which is an indirect effect through the ReplicaSet controller. But the example directly links scale to pods. So maybe even indirect effects are considered if they're the primary outcome.

Thus, for certificatesigningrequests/approval, if the outcome is that a secret is created with the signed certificate, then the resource

Prompt: Please make the API Sub-Resource Reference analysis of horizontalpodautoscalers/status. Just list the final results such as 'horizontalpodautoscalers/status --> otherRes', without explanation.

Answer: 
Thinking...
Okay, I need to perform an API Sub-Resource Reference analysis for horizontalpodautoscalers/status. According to the examples given, when a sub-resource like nodes/status is updated, it affects the node's status, so the reference is nodes/status --> nodes. Similarly, deployments/status would reference deployments.

So, horizontalpodautoscalers/status is a sub-resource that updates the status of a HorizontalPodAutoscaler (HPA). The primary resource here is the HPA itself. Updating the status would directly impact the HPA resource's status field. Therefore, the resource reference should be horizontalpodautoscalers/status --> horizontalpodautoscalers.

I don't think the status sub-resource affects other resources like pods or deployments directly. The HPA's status shows information like current replicas and metrics, but the status update itself doesn't create or modify other resources. So, the only reference is to the HPA resource.
horizontalpodautoscalers/status --> horizontalpodautoscalers

Prompt: Review your answer against the initial definitions:  
1. Did you avoid introducing unrelated resources?
Answer "Pass" if compliant, or "Fail: [reason]" if not.
If the answer is fail, please correct the result.

Answer: 
Thinking...
Alright, let's review my previous answer against the user's initial definitions to ensure compliance.

The user asked for an API Sub-Resource Reference analysis of horizontalpodautoscalers/status. My answer was horizontalpodautoscalers/status --> horizontalpodautoscalers.

According to the initial examples, sub-resources like nodes/status reference the main resource (nodes), which is exactly the pattern I followed here. The analysis correctly identifies that updating the status sub-resource affects the main resource's status field, without introducing any unrelated resources like pods or deployments.

Since the answer directly maps the sub-resource to its parent resource and doesn't include any unrelated resources, it complies with the user's guidelines. Therefore, the answer passes the check.
Pass

Prompt: The verbs supported by horizontalpodautoscalers/status resource include: [Get Update Patch]
Based on the verb obtained above, please make the subresource permission reference analysis of horizontalpodautoscalers/status. Just list the results of permission reference, such as 'verb horizontalpodautoscalers/status --> create B', without explanation.

Answer: 
Thinking...
Alright, let's tackle the permission reference analysis for horizontalpodautoscalers/status. The supported verbs are Get, Update, and Patch.

First, looking at the examples provided earlier. For nodes/status, the permissions were mapped as patch/update nodes/status leading to patch/update nodes. Similarly, services/status would follow the same logic.

So for get horizontalpodautoscalers/status, since getting the status sub-resource is part of the HPA itself, the permission needed would be get on horizontalpodautoscalers. But according to the initial examples, accessing the status sub-resource's get might not map directly. Wait, in the examples, pods/exec required get secrets because of mounted secrets, but for status sub-resources, the initial examples like nodes/status linked to the same verb on the main resource.

Wait, for nodes/status, the permission references were patch nodes/status --> patch nodes and update nodes/status --> update nodes. So applying that here, updating horizontalpodautoscalers/status would require update horizontalpodautoscalers, and patching would require patch horizontalpodautoscalers. The get verb on the status sub-resource would map to get on the main resource.

But the initial examples didn't include get for status sub-resources. For instance, nodes/status only mentioned update/patch. However, logically, to get the status sub-resource, you need permission to get it, which is part of the main resource. But according to Kubernetes RBAC, sub-resources like status require explicit permissions. However, the user's examples simplify this by linking the sub-resource operation to the main resource's verb. So following the pattern:

get horizontalpodautoscalers/status --> get horizontalpodautoscalers
update horizontalpodautoscalers/status --> update horizontalpodautoscalers
patch horizontalpodautoscalers/status --> patch horizontalpodautoscalers

This matches the structure from the nodes/status example. Therefore, the permission references are straightforward, mapping each verb on the sub-resource to the same verb on the main resource.
get horizontalpodautoscalers/status --> get horizontalpodautoscalers
update horizontalpodautoscalers/status --> update horizontalpodautoscalers
patch horizontalpodautoscalers/status --> patch horizontalpodautoscalers

Prompt: Review your answer against the initial definitions:
1. Did you avoid introducing unrelated permission references?  
Answer "Pass" if compliant, or "Fail: [reason]" if not.
If the answer is fail, please correct the result.

Answer: 
Thinking...
Okay, let me review my previous answer for the permission reference analysis of horizontalpodautoscalers/status. The supported verbs were Get, Update, and Patch. I mapped each of these verbs on the sub-resource to the same verbs on the main resource, like get horizontalpodautoscalers/status --> get horizontalpodautoscalers.

Looking back at the user's examples, such as nodes/status, the permission references were patch nodes/status --> patch nodes and update nodes/status --> update nodes. This follows the same pattern I used. The initial definitions focused on how sub-resource operations relate to permissions on the main resource without introducing other resources or permissions. Since my answer only maps the sub-resource verbs to the corresponding main resource verbs without adding unrelated permissions (like create or delete), it aligns with the examples provided.

Therefore, the answer doesn't include any unrelated permission references and strictly follows the established pattern. It should be compliant.
Pass
