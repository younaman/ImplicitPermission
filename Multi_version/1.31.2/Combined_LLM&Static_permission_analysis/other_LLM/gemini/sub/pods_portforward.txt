Prompt: As a Kubernetes expert, specializing in identifying API Sub-Resource reference and API Sub-Resource Permission Reference. Your task is to make the sub-resource reference analysis and sub-resource permission reference analysis.
Regarding the API Sub-Resource Reference analysis, it is defined as follows: In the context of Kubernetes, sub-resource reference analysis can be understood as analyzing the relationship between sub-resources and other resources. Below are some examples:
1. For pods/exec, creating pods/exec can execute commands in Pod, and secrets is mounted in pod, so there are the following resource reference: pods/exec --> secrets.
2. For pods/eviction, creating pods/eviction can expel the specified pod, so there are the following resource reference: pods/eviction --> pods.
3. For replicasets/scale, updating replicasets/scale can update the number of pods, so there are the following resource reference: replicasets/scale --> pods.
4. For nodes/status, updating nodes/status can update the status field of node, so there are the following resource reference: nodes/status --> nodes.
5. For statefulsets/scale, updating statefulsets/scale can update the number of pods, so there are the following resource reference: statefulsets/scale --> pods.
Regarding the API Sub-Resource Permission Reference analysis, it is defined as follows: In the context of Kubernetes, sub-resource permission reference analysis can be understood as analyzing how operations on sub-resources might affect other API resources or trigger operations on other API resources. Below are some examples:
1. For pod/exec, creating pods/exec can access the terminal session of a pod and access the contents of secrets mounted in the pod. Therefore, it can be concluded: create pods/exec --> get secrets.
2. For pods/eviction, creating pods/eviction can delete the specified pod. Therefore, it can be concluded: create pods/eviction --> delete pod.
3. For replicasets/scale, patching or updating replicasets/scale can adjust the number of Pods managed by the ReplicaSets, thereby increasing or decreasing the number of Pod resources. Therefore, it can be concluded: patch replicasets/scale --> create Pod, update replicasets/scale --> create Pod, patch replicasets/scale --> delete Pod, update replicasets/scale --> delete Pod.
4. For nodes/status, patching or updating nodes/status can affect the status of Nodes. Therefore, it can be concluded: patch nodes/status --> patch nodes, update nodes/status --> update nodes.
5. For statefulsets/scale, patching or updating statefulsets/scale can adjust the number of Pods managed by the StatefulSets, thereby increasing or decreasing the number of Pod resources. Therefore, it can be concluded: patch statefulsets/scale --> create Pod, update statefulsets/scale --> create Pod, patch statefulsets/scale --> delete Pod, update statefulsets/scale --> delete Pod.
Do you understand the above concepts, and are you ready to start the analysis? Answer yes or no.

Answer: 
Yes

Prompt: Please make the API Sub-Resource Reference analysis of pods/portforward. Just list the final results such as 'pods/portforward --> otherRes', without explanation.

Answer: 
pods/portforward --> pods

Prompt: Review your answer against the initial definitions:  
1. Did you avoid introducing unrelated resources?
Answer "Pass" if compliant, or "Fail: [reason]" if not.
If the answer is fail, please correct the result.

Answer: 
Pass

Prompt: The verbs supported by pods/portforward resource include: [Get Create]
Based on the verb obtained above, please make the subresource permission reference analysis of pods/portforward. Just list the results of permission reference, such as 'verb pods/portforward --> create B', without explanation.

Answer: 
Here's the subresource permission reference analysis for pods/portforward, based on the provided verbs (Get, Create):
create pods/portforward --> create pods/portforward
get pods/portforward --> get pods

Prompt: Review your answer against the initial definitions:
1. Did you avoid introducing unrelated permission references?  
Answer "Pass" if compliant, or "Fail: [reason]" if not.
If the answer is fail, please correct the result.

Answer: 
Fail: The previous answer included tautological permission references (create pods/portforward --> create pods/portforward) and did not fully capture the essence of the provided examples, which focus on how operations on a subresource affect other resources. While get pods/portforward correctly implies a need to get pods, creating a port forward doesn't create a pod/portforward resource in the same way it might affect other resources. It uses the pod. The spirit of the examples is to show how subresource actions impact other resources.
Corrected Result:
create pods/portforward --> get pods
get pods/portforward --> get pods
