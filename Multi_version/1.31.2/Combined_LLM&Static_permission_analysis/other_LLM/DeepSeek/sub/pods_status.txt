Prompt: As a Kubernetes expert, specializing in identifying API Sub-Resource reference and API Sub-Resource Permission Reference. Your task is to make the sub-resource reference analysis and sub-resource permission reference analysis.
Regarding the API Sub-Resource Reference analysis, it is defined as follows: In the context of Kubernetes, sub-resource reference analysis can be understood as analyzing the relationship between sub-resources and other resources. Below are some examples:
1. For pods/exec, creating pods/exec can execute commands in Pod, and secrets is mounted in pod, so there are the following resource reference: pods/exec --> secrets.
2. For pods/eviction, creating pods/eviction can expel the specified pod, so there are the following resource reference: pods/eviction --> pods.
3. For replicasets/scale, updating replicasets/scale can update the number of pods, so there are the following resource reference: replicasets/scale --> pods.
4. For nodes/status, updating nodes/status can update the status field of node, so there are the following resource reference: nodes/status --> nodes.
5. For statefulsets/scale, updating statefulsets/scale can update the number of pods, so there are the following resource reference: statefulsets/scale --> pods.
Regarding the API Sub-Resource Permission Reference analysis, it is defined as follows: In the context of Kubernetes, sub-resource permission reference analysis can be understood as analyzing how operations on sub-resources might affect other API resources or trigger operations on other API resources. Below are some examples:
1. For pod/exec, creating pods/exec can access the terminal session of a pod and access the contents of secrets mounted in the pod. Therefore, it can be concluded: create pods/exec --> get secrets.
2. For pods/eviction, creating pods/eviction can delete the specified pod. Therefore, it can be concluded: create pods/eviction --> delete pod.
3. For replicasets/scale, patching or updating replicasets/scale can adjust the number of Pods managed by the ReplicaSets, thereby increasing or decreasing the number of Pod resources. Therefore, it can be concluded: patch replicasets/scale --> create Pod, update replicasets/scale --> create Pod, patch replicasets/scale --> delete Pod, update replicasets/scale --> delete Pod.
4. For nodes/status, patching or updating nodes/status can affect the status of Nodes. Therefore, it can be concluded: patch nodes/status --> patch nodes, update nodes/status --> update nodes.
5. For statefulsets/scale, patching or updating statefulsets/scale can adjust the number of Pods managed by the StatefulSets, thereby increasing or decreasing the number of Pod resources. Therefore, it can be concluded: patch statefulsets/scale --> create Pod, update statefulsets/scale --> create Pod, patch statefulsets/scale --> delete Pod, update statefulsets/scale --> delete Pod.
Do you understand the above concepts, and are you ready to start the analysis? Answer yes or no.

Answer: 
Thinking...
Okay, let's start by understanding what the user is asking for. They want me to perform two types of analyses on Kubernetes API sub-resources: Sub-Resource Reference Analysis and Sub-Resource Permission Reference Analysis.

First, the Sub-Resource Reference Analysis involves figuring out how a sub-resource relates to other resources. For example, pods/exec relates to secrets because secrets might be mounted in the pod. So when someone uses pods/exec, they might be accessing secrets. Got it.

Then there's the Permission Reference Analysis. This is about how operations on a sub-resource affect other resources in terms of permissions. Like creating a pods/eviction actually deletes a pod, so the permission required would be delete on pods. So I need to map the HTTP verbs on the sub-resource to the corresponding verbs on other resources.

Let me think of a sub-resource like deployments/status. Updating deployments/status would affect the deployment's status. So for the reference analysis, deployments/status --> deployments. For permission, if I update deployments/status, maybe that requires patch or update on deployments. But wait, the status sub-resource is often writable separately from the spec. So maybe the permission would be update deployments/status leading to patch deployments, but I need to check how that works.

Another example: daemonsets/scale. Similar to replicasets/scale, scaling a daemonset changes the number of pods, so daemonsets/scale --> pods. For permissions, updating daemonsets/scale would require create and delete pods, similar to the replicasets example.

What about roles/status? If updating roles/status affects the role's status, then the reference would be roles/status --> roles. For permissions, maybe patch roles/status requires patch on roles.

Wait, but in Kubernetes, some sub-resources have separate permissions. For instance, to update the status, you might need update on the status sub-resource, not the main resource. But the permission reference analysis is about how the operation on the sub-resource affects other resources. So if updating status doesn't directly affect another resource but updates the parent, then the permission reference would be like update roles/status --> update roles (specifically the status part). But according to the examples given, like nodes/status, patching nodes/status leads to patch nodes. So maybe it's similar.

Another sub-resource to consider: podtemplates. Wait, maybe not. Let me think of common sub-resources. For example, podsecuritypolicies. Hmm, maybe not. Let's take cronjobs/status. Updating cronjobs/status would reference cronjobs. Permission-wise, updating cronjobs/status would require update on cronjobs/status, but how does that translate? Maybe it's similar to nodes/status, so update cronjobs/status --> update cronjobs.

Also, consider bindings. Like serviceaccounts/token is a sub-resource for creating tokens. Creating a serviceaccounts/token would generate a token secret. So the reference would be serviceaccounts/token --> secrets. For permissions, creating it might require create on serviceaccounts/token, which in turn creates a secret, so create serviceaccounts/token --> create secrets. But I need to check if that's accurate.

Wait, in the examples given, pods/exec doesn't create a secret but accesses it. So the permission is get secrets. Similarly, creating a token might generate a secret, so maybe create serviceaccounts/token --> create secrets. But I need to confirm if that's how it works. For instance, when you create a token for a service account, Kubernetes automatically generates a secret that holds the token. So the action of creating the token sub-resource would result in creating a secret. Therefore, the permission reference would be create serviceaccounts/token --> create secrets.

Another example: leases in coordination.k8s.io. Updating a lease might just update the lease itself, but perhaps it's used by node controllers. Not sure if that's relevant here.

Wait, the key is to follow the examples provided. Let's stick to the structure given. For each sub-resource, determine the resource it references (Reference Analysis) and then map the HTTP verbs on the sub-resource to the verbs required on other resources (Permission Analysis).

Let's take another example: deployments/rollback. The rollback sub-resource of deployments. Creating a rollback would roll back the deployment to a previous revision. This action would affect the deployment's spec, so the reference would be deployments/rollback --> deployments. For permissions, creating a rollback might require update on deployments, since it's modifying the deployment's configuration. So create deployments/rollback --> update deployments.

Or, maybe more accurately, the rollback sub-resource is part of the extensions/v1beta1 API, and the action of rolling back might involve creating a new rollout, which changes the replica sets and pods. So maybe the reference is deployments/rollback --> replicasets, pods. But according to the examples, like replicasets/scale --> pods, the direct effect is on pods. So in the case of rollback, maybe deployments/rollback --> replicasets, because rolling back a deployment creates a new replicaset. Then for permission, creating deployments/rollback would require create replicasets, or update deployments?

Hmm, this might be getting too complicated. Let's think of another sub-resource: service/proxy. The proxy sub-resource allows accessing the service's proxy. Accessing service/proxy might require accessing pods behind the service, so service/proxy --> pods. For permission, accessing (get, post, etc.) service/proxy might require get pods, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it might not directly reference pods but just the service's endpoints.

Alternatively, maybe service/proxy doesn't directly reference another resource but requires permissions to access the service itself. But according to the examples, the reference is about which resources are affected or involved. So if using service/proxy allows accessing pods, then service/proxy --> pods. But I'm not entirely certain. Maybe it's better to stick with more straightforward examples.

Let's consider endpoints in the core API. The endpoints resource is managed by the endpoints controller, but if a user updates endpoints directly, that affects the service. However, endpoints isn't a sub-resource. Wait, maybe not. Let's think again.

Another sub-resource: podtemplates. No, podtemplates are separate resources. Maybe namespaces/status. Updating namespaces/status would affect namespaces, so the reference is namespaces/status --> namespaces. For permission, patch namespaces/status --> patch namespaces.

I think I need to structure this step by step. For each sub-resource:

Identify the API path, like pods/exec, deployments/scale, etc.
Determine what other resources are affected when this sub-resource is accessed or modified.
For the permission reference, map the HTTP verb on the sub-resource to the corresponding verbs on other resources.

Let me try with a new example: daemonsets/status. Updating daemonsets/status affects the status of the daemonset, so the reference is daemonsets/status --> daemonsets. For permission, updating daemonsets/status would require update daemonsets/status, but according to the nodes/status example, the permission reference would be patch daemonsets/status --> patch daemonsets.

Another example: jobs/status. Similarly, jobs/status --> jobs, and patch jobs/status --> patch jobs.

Now, what about persistentvolumeclaims/status. Updating that would reference persistentvolumeclaims. So the reference is persistentvolumeclaims/status --> persistentvolumeclaims. Permission-wise, patch persistentvolumeclaims/status --> patch persistentvolumeclaims.

Another possible sub-resource: certificatesigningrequests/approval. Approving a CSR would change its status. So certificatesigningrequests/approval --> certificatesigningrequests. For permissions, creating or updating the approval sub-resource would require update certificatesigningrequests, perhaps specifically the approval sub-resource. But according to examples, it might be create certificatesigningrequests/approval --> update certificatesigningrequests.

Wait, in Kubernetes, to approve a CSR, you send a PATCH to the approval sub-resource. So the operation is update or patch on certificatesigningrequests/status or approval. So the permission reference would be update certificatesigningrequests/approval --> update certificatesigningrequests.

But maybe the actual effect is that the CSR's status is updated, so the permission would map to update on the CSR resource's status. But the examples like nodes/status show that patching nodes/status leads to patch nodes, so maybe similarly, patching certificatesigningrequests/approval would lead to patch certificatesigningrequests.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let's check another example from the user's examples. For pods/eviction, creating it leads to deleting the pod. So the permission is create pods/eviction --> delete pods. So the verb on the sub-resource (create) maps to delete on pods.

In the case of certificatesigningrequests/approval, approving might require sending a PATCH to the approval sub-resource. Suppose that the permission required is update certificatesigningrequests/approval, which in turn requires approve verb on certificatesigningrequests resources. Wait, Kubernetes has specific RBAC verbs for CSRs: approve, sign, etc. So maybe the actual permission is approve on certificatesigningrequests. But according to the user's framework, they map the operation on the sub-resource to the permission on another resource. So if I update certificatesigningrequests/approval, that might require update certificatesigningrequests, or it's a separate permission.

This is getting a bit complicated. Perhaps I should focus on the examples given and follow their pattern. For instance, if there's a sub-resource X, then:

For resource reference: X --> Y if using X affects Y.
For permission reference: verb X --> verb Y on resource Z.

So, for certificatesigningrequests/approval, the action on the sub-resource (e.g., update) would affect the certificatesigningrequests resource itself. So the permission reference would be update certificatesigningrequests/approval --> update certificatesigningrequests. But in reality, the approve verb is separate. However, the user's examples might not account for specific verbs beyond the standard ones (get, create, update, patch, delete). So in their framework, it would map to update.

Alternatively, maybe the permission required to approve a CSR is the approve verb on the certificatesigningrequests resource. So the permission reference would be update certificatesigningrequests/approval --> approve certificatesigningrequests. But the user's examples use more general verbs. For example, pods/eviction requires delete pod, which is a standard verb. So perhaps I should stick to standard verbs unless specified otherwise.

This is a bit unclear, but maybe in the context of the user's examples, they map the sub-resource operation to the most directly related standard verb on the main resource. So for CSR approval, the permission reference would be update certificatesigningrequests/approval --> update certificatesigningrequests.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let's think of another example from the user: pods/eviction's permission is create --> delete pod. So the sub-resource's create verb maps to delete on pod. Similarly, for replicasets/scale, update maps to create and delete pods. So the key is to see what action on the sub-resource causes what action on another resource.

In the case of CSRs, approving (via the approval sub-resource) causes the CSR's status to be updated, which in turn may lead to the certificate being issued. So the direct effect is on the CSR itself. So the permission reference would be update certificatesigningrequests/approval --> update certificatesigningrequests.

But maybe the actual permission needed is approve, which is a separate verb. However, according to the examples given, they use standard verbs. For example, in the pods/exec example, the permission is get secrets, which is a standard verb. So perhaps in this context, it's acceptable to map to standard verbs even if specific ones exist. Therefore, update certificatesigningrequests/approval --> update certificatesigningrequests.

Another example: roles/bindings. Wait, roles and rolebindings are separate resources. Maybe not a sub-resource. Let's consider storageclasses/status. Updating storageclasses/status affects storageclasses, so reference is storageclasses/status --> storageclasses. Permission-wise, patch storageclasses/status --> patch storageclasses.

Another thought: What about the log sub-resource of pods? pods/log. Accessing pods/log allows reading the logs of a container, which might require access to the pod's data. So the resource reference would be pods/log --> pods. For permission reference, get pods/log --> get pods. Because to read the logs, you need get access on pods. But maybe more accurately, get pods/log requires get on pods/log, but in terms of affecting other resources, it's just reading the logs, which doesn't modify anything. However, in the examples given, pods/exec requires get secrets because the pod may have mounted secrets. So for pods/log, maybe it's similar: get pods/log --> get pods, and if the pod has volumes from secrets, then maybe get pods/log --> get secrets. But that depends on whether the logs somehow expose secret data. Probably not directly, so maybe just get pods/log --> get pods.

But according to the user's first example, pods/exec --> secrets because secrets are mounted. So maybe if a pod's logs could expose secret data (e.g., if the app logs the secret's content), then pods/log --> secrets. But that's a stretch. Probably, the direct reference is pods/log --> pods. Permission-wise, get pods/log --> get pods.

Another example: deployments/scale. Similar to replicasets/scale. Updating deployments/scale would adjust the replica count, which is managed by the underlying replicaset. So the reference is deployments/scale --> replicasets, and then replicasets/scale --> pods. But according to the user's examples, replicasets/scale directly references pods. So following that, deployments/scale --> pods, and the permission reference would be update deployments/scale --> create/delete pods.

But wait, deployments manage replicasets, which in turn manage pods. So scaling a deployment updates the replicaset's desired replicas. So maybe deployments/scale --> replicasets, and replicasets/scale --> pods. But the user's examples have replicasets/scale --> pods. So maybe the user's analysis skips intermediate resources and directly links to the end resource (pods). Therefore, deployments/scale --> pods. Similarly, the permission reference would be update deployments/scale --> create/delete pods.

I need to check how the user's examples handle such chaining. For example, in the case of replicasets/scale, it directly points to pods, not considering that replicasets create pods. So following that pattern, deployments/scale would also directly reference pods. So deployments/scale --> pods. For the permission reference, update deployments/scale would lead to create and delete pods, just like with replicasets.

Another sub-resource: horizontalpodautoscalers/status. Updating that would affect the HPA's status. So the reference is horizontalpodautoscalers/status --> horizontalpodautoscalers. Permission-wise, patch horizontalpodautoscalers/status --> patch horizontalpodautoscalers.

Let me summarize the approach:

For each sub-resource:

Identify the main resource it's a part of (e.g., pods/exec is a sub-resource of pods).
Determine which other resources are affected when this sub-resource is used. For example, pods/exec affects secrets because secrets are mounted in the pod.
For permission references, determine which operations on the sub-resource require which permissions on other resources. For example, creating pods/exec requires get on secrets.

Now, applying this to a new sub-resource like services/status:

Reference analysis: services/status --> services, because updating the status affects the service resource.
Permission analysis: patch services/status --> patch services, update services/status --> update services.

Another example: endpointslices. Wait, endpointslices are separate resources managed by the endpoints controller. Not a sub-resource. Let's think of networkpolicies/status. Updating networkpolicies/status would affect the networkpolicy resource, so reference is networkpolicies/status --> networkpolicies. Permission-wise, patch networkpolicies/status --> patch networkpolicies.

What about custom resources? Suppose there's a custom resource MyCRD and a sub-resource mycrd/scale. Similar to standard scale sub-resources, updating mycrd/scale would adjust the number of pods, assuming MyCRD manages pods. So the reference would be mycrd/scale --> pods. Permission reference: update mycrd/scale --> create/delete pods.

This seems to follow the pattern of the user's examples.

Another example: poddisruptionbudgets/status. Updating the status affects the poddisruptionbudget resource. So reference: poddisruptionbudgets/status --> poddisruptionbudgets. Permission: patch poddisruptionbudgets/status --> patch poddisruptionbudgets.

Now, considering all this, when presented with a new sub-resource, I need to:

Identify the main resource it's a part of.
Determine which other resources are directly affected or involved when using this sub-resource.
For permissions, map the HTTP verbs used on the sub-resource to the necessary verbs on other resources, based on what actions are triggered.

Potential mistakes to avoid:

Overcomplicating by including intermediate resources (like deployments/scale affecting replicasets first, but the examples directly link to pods).
Confusing between the sub-resource's own permissions and the parent resource's permissions. For example, updating a sub-resource's status might require permissions on the sub-resource, but in terms of affecting the parent resource, it's considered an update to the parent.

I need to ensure that each analysis strictly follows the examples given, even if real-world Kubernetes might have more nuances. The user provided specific patterns, so I should adhere to those patterns unless instructed otherwise.
Yes. I'm ready to perform both API Sub-Resource Reference Analysis and API Sub-Resource Permission Reference Analysis based on the defined patterns. Please provide the sub-resource(s) you’d like me to analyze, and I’ll break down the relationships and permissions systematically.

Prompt: Please make the API Sub-Resource Reference analysis of pods/status. Just list the final results such as 'pods/status --> otherRes', without explanation.

Answer: 
Thinking...
Okay, the user is asking for the API Sub-Resource Reference analysis of pods/status. Let me recall how this works. The task is to determine the relationship between the sub-resource and other resources.

From the examples given earlier, like nodes/status, updating nodes/status affects the node's status field. So nodes/status --> nodes. Similarly, pods/status would affect the pod's status. So the reference here should be pods/status --> pods.

The user wants just the final result in the format 'pods/status --> otherRes'. No explanations needed. I need to make sure there's no additional information, just the line as specified.
pods/status --> pods.

Prompt: Review your answer against the initial definitions:  
1. Did you avoid introducing unrelated resources?
Answer "Pass" if compliant, or "Fail: [reason]" if not.
If the answer is fail, please correct the result.

Answer: 
Thinking...
Alright, let's check if my previous answer for pods/status --> pods aligns with the user's initial definitions.

The user provided examples like nodes/status --> nodes, where the sub-resource directly references its parent resource. Similarly, pods/status is a sub-resource of pods, and updating it affects the pod's status. This matches the pattern exactly. I didn't include any other resources (like secrets or pods), so there's no unrelated resource mentioned. Therefore, it's compliant.

Pass.
Pass

Prompt: The verbs supported by pods/status resource include: [Get Update Patch]
Based on the verb obtained above, please make the subresource permission reference analysis of pods/status. Just list the results of permission reference, such as 'verb pods/status --> create B', without explanation.

Answer: 
Thinking...
Alright, I need to perform the API Sub-Resource Permission Reference analysis for pods/status, considering the supported verbs: Get, Update, Patch.

First, let's look at the examples provided by the user. For nodes/status, the verbs Patch and Update on nodes/status map to Patch and Update on nodes. So, similar logic should apply here.

For pods/status:

Get pods/status: This action retrieves the status of the pod. Since it's just reading the status, the permission required would be Get on pods (as the status is part of the pod resource).
Update pods/status: Updating the status affects the pod's status field. Following the node example, Update on pods/status would require Update on pods.
Patch pods/status: Similarly, patching the status would require Patch on pods.

The user’s examples like nodes/status show that verbs on the sub-resource map to the same verbs on the parent resource. Therefore, each verb for pods/status (Get, Update, Patch) maps directly to the same verb on pods. There’s no introduction of unrelated resources, and this aligns with the initial patterns provided. No additional permissions beyond the parent resource are needed here.
get pods/status --> get pods
update pods/status --> update pods
patch pods/status --> patch pods

Prompt: Review your answer against the initial definitions:
1. Did you avoid introducing unrelated permission references?  
Answer "Pass" if compliant, or "Fail: [reason]" if not.
If the answer is fail, please correct the result.

Answer: 
Thinking...
Alright, let's check my previous answer for the permission references of pods/status against the initial examples.

The user’s examples for nodes/status showed that actions on the sub-resource (patch/update) mapped directly to the same verbs on the parent resource (patch/update nodes). Similarly, I mapped get/update/patch on pods/status to get/update/patch on pods. There are no additional permissions like create or delete introduced here, which aren't related. This matches the structure of the initial examples (e.g., nodes/status --> patch nodes). Therefore, it's compliant.

Pass.
