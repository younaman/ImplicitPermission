Prompt: As a Kubernetes expert, specializing in identifying API Sub-Resource reference and API Sub-Resource Permission Reference. Your task is to make the sub-resource reference analysis and sub-resource permission reference analysis.
Regarding the API Sub-Resource Reference analysis, it is defined as follows: In the context of Kubernetes, sub-resource reference analysis can be understood as analyzing the relationship between sub-resources and other resources. Below are some examples:
1. For pods/exec, creating pods/exec can execute commands in Pod, and secrets is mounted in pod, so there are the following resource reference: pods/exec --> secrets.
2. For pods/eviction, creating pods/eviction can expel the specified pod, so there are the following resource reference: pods/eviction --> pods.
3. For replicasets/scale, updating replicasets/scale can update the number of pods, so there are the following resource reference: replicasets/scale --> pods.
4. For nodes/status, updating nodes/status can update the status field of node, so there are the following resource reference: nodes/status --> nodes.
5. For statefulsets/scale, updating statefulsets/scale can update the number of pods, so there are the following resource reference: statefulsets/scale --> pods.
Regarding the API Sub-Resource Permission Reference analysis, it is defined as follows: In the context of Kubernetes, sub-resource permission reference analysis can be understood as analyzing how operations on sub-resources might affect other API resources or trigger operations on other API resources. Below are some examples:
1. For pod/exec, creating pods/exec can access the terminal session of a pod and access the contents of secrets mounted in the pod. Therefore, it can be concluded: create pods/exec --> get secrets.
2. For pods/eviction, creating pods/eviction can delete the specified pod. Therefore, it can be concluded: create pods/eviction --> delete pod.
3. For replicasets/scale, patching or updating replicasets/scale can adjust the number of Pods managed by the ReplicaSets, thereby increasing or decreasing the number of Pod resources. Therefore, it can be concluded: patch replicasets/scale --> create Pod, update replicasets/scale --> create Pod, patch replicasets/scale --> delete Pod, update replicasets/scale --> delete Pod.
4. For nodes/status, patching or updating nodes/status can affect the status of Nodes. Therefore, it can be concluded: patch nodes/status --> patch nodes, update nodes/status --> update nodes.
5. For statefulsets/scale, patching or updating statefulsets/scale can adjust the number of Pods managed by the StatefulSets, thereby increasing or decreasing the number of Pod resources. Therefore, it can be concluded: patch statefulsets/scale --> create Pod, update statefulsets/scale --> create Pod, patch statefulsets/scale --> delete Pod, update statefulsets/scale --> delete Pod.
Do you understand the above concepts, and are you ready to start the analysis? Answer yes or no.

Answer: 
Thinking...
Okay, so I need to act as a Kubernetes expert and analyze both API Sub-Resource References and their Permission References. Let me start by recalling the examples provided.

For the Sub-Resource Reference analysis, the task is to find relationships between a sub-resource and other resources. For example, pods/exec references secrets because secrets are mounted in the pod. Similarly, pods/eviction affects pods themselves. The key here is to understand how a sub-resource interacts with or impacts other resources.

Then, for the Permission Reference analysis, it's about how operations on the sub-resource require or affect permissions on other resources. For instance, creating pods/exec requires get access to secrets because the pod might have mounted secrets. Similarly, creating a pods/eviction requires delete permission on pods.

Let me think about some common sub-resources. Maybe something like deployments/status. Updating deployments/status would affect the deployment's status, so the reference would be deployments/status --> deployments. Permission-wise, updating deployments/status might require update permissions on deployments, but the example shows nodes/status leading to patch nodes. Wait, in the examples, nodes/status's permission reference was that patching nodes/status leads to patching nodes. So maybe for deployments/status, updating or patching it would require patch or update permissions on deployments themselves.

Another sub-resource could be services/status. Updating services/status would reference services. Permission-wise, similar to nodes/status, it would require patch or update on services.

What about something like rolebindings? Hmm, not sure if there's a sub-resource there. Let's think about cronjobs. For jobs, maybe cronjobs/status. But perhaps cronjobs have a suspend sub-resource, like cronjobs/suspend. If you update cronjobs/suspend, you're modifying the cronjob's suspend status. So cronjobs/suspend --> cronjobs. For permissions, patching cronjobs/suspend would require update on cronjobs.

Another example: endpointslices. Maybe endpointslices/status. Updating that would affect endpointslices, so reference is endpointslices/status --> endpointslices. Permission would be patch endpointslices/status --> patch endpointslices.

What about podtemplates? Not sure. Let's think of another one. Persistentvolumeclaims/status. Updating that would reference the PVC itself. So persistentvolumeclaims/status --> persistentvolumeclaims. Permission reference would be patch persistentvolumeclaims/status --> patch persistentvolumeclaims.

Wait, the examples given include things like scale sub-resources. For example, replicasets/scale affects pods. So any scale sub-resource, like deployments/scale, would also reference pods. So deployments/scale --> pods. Similarly, updating deployments/scale would require create or delete pods, similar to replicasets/scale.

Also, there's the eviction sub-resource for pods. Another example could be leases in coordination.k8s.io. For leases, maybe leases/status, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe podsecurity/policies, but that's deprecated.

Another thought: daemonsets/status. Updating daemonsets/status would reference daemonsets. Permission: patch daemonsets/status --> patch daemonsets.

Wait, but the user might want me to come up with new examples beyond the ones provided. Let me check if there are other sub-resources in Kubernetes. Common sub-resources include:

/status (common across many resources)
/scale (for scaling)
/exec, /attach, /portforward (for pods)
/eviction (for pods)
/log (for pods)
/binding (for pods)
/approval (for certificates)
/proxy (for services, pods, etc.)

For example, pods/log. Accessing pods/log allows reading the logs of a pod. So the resource reference would be pods/log --> pods. But permission-wise, getting pods/log would require get access to pods. So get pods/log --> get pods.

Another example: certificatesigningrequests/approval. Approving a CSR would reference the CSR itself, so certificatesigningrequests/approval --> certificatesigningrequests. Permission-wise, creating or updating the approval sub-resource would require approve permission on certificatesigningrequests.

What about bindings? For pods/binding. Creating a pods/binding allows assigning a pod to a node, which affects the pod's nodeName. So resource reference: pods/binding --> pods. Permission-wise, creating pods/binding would require create pods/binding, but also update pods, since the pod's spec is being modified. Wait, but in Kubernetes, who can create a binding? Typically, the scheduler. So maybe the permission reference would be create pods/binding --> update pods.

Wait, the examples given for permission references link the action on the sub-resource to the required permission on the target resource. For pods/exec, create pods/exec requires get secrets. Because the pod may have secrets mounted, so accessing the pod's exec might require accessing the secrets. Similarly, for pods/eviction, creating it requires delete pod.

So for pods/binding, creating it might require update pods, because you're updating the pod's node assignment. So create pods/binding --> update pods.

Another example: services/proxy. Accessing services/proxy would allow proxying to the service, which might require access to the service and the pods behind it. So resource reference: services/proxy --> services, and maybe endpoints. But the permission reference would be get services/proxy --> get services, and maybe get pods if the proxy is accessing pods.

But perhaps the main reference is services/proxy --> services. Permission-wise, accessing services/proxy would require get on services and maybe create on pods/portforward if it's proxying through a pod.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me stick to the examples given. The key is to identify the sub-resource, determine which resource it references (like the parent resource or another resource it affects), and then for permissions, see which operations on the sub-resource require which permissions on other resources.

Another example: roles/restriction. Not sure. Maybe networkpolicies/status. Updating networkpolicies/status would reference networkpolicies. Permission-wise, patch networkpolicies/status --> patch networkpolicies.

Let me think of another one. Ingresses/status. Updating ingresses/status would reference ingresses. So Ingresses/status --> ingresses. Permission reference: patch ingresses/status --> patch ingresses.

What about horizontalpodautoscalers/status? Similar to others, horizontalpodautoscalers/status --> horizontalpodautoscalers. Permission: patch horizontalpodautoscalers/status --> patch horizontalpodautoscalers.

Another sub-resource: podsecuritypolicies (though deprecated). Maybe podsecuritypolicies/use, but not sure. Alternatively, for volumeattachments, volumeattachments/status. Updating status would reference volumeattachments.

In terms of permissions, any sub-resource that's part of a resource's status would likely require permissions to update the status, which in some cases might map to the main resource's update or patch verb.

Another example: nodes/proxy. Accessing nodes/proxy allows proxying requests to nodes. So resource reference: nodes/proxy --> nodes. Permission-wise, accessing nodes/proxy would require get nodes and maybe create pods/exec or something else if proxying through a pod. But maybe the permission is get nodes/proxy --> get nodes.

Wait, the examples given for permission reference include the action on the sub-resource leading to the required permission. For instance, create pods/exec --> get secrets. So if I'm creating a pods/exec, I need to be able to get secrets because the pod might have mounted secrets. Similarly, for nodes/proxy, creating a proxy session might require get nodes.

But perhaps the exact permissions depend on how the sub-resource is implemented. For example, using pods/proxy might require "get" access to pods and "create" on pods/proxy. But according to Kubernetes RBAC, to use pods/proxy, you need the "create" verb on pods/proxy sub-resource. But maybe if the proxy is connecting to the pod's network, it might require access to the pod's endpoints, which are part of the service. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's simpler. For example, using pods/portforward requires the "create" permission on pods/portforward, which in turn allows the user to set up port forwarding, but that action doesn't directly reference another resource beyond the pod itself. So the resource reference would be pods/portforward --> pods. Permission reference: create pods/portforward --> get pods (if needing to know the pod exists) and maybe something else, but according to the examples, maybe it's just the direct permission. Wait, in the examples, pods/exec required get secrets because secrets are mounted. So for pods/portforward, since it's about networking, maybe it requires get services or get endpoints? Not sure. Maybe it's just pods/portforward --> pods for resource reference, and create pods/portforward --> get pods for permission.

But maybe the key is to follow the pattern: if a sub-resource operation affects or uses another resource, then that's the reference. For example, if creating a pods/exec uses secrets mounted in the pod, then the reference is to secrets. For portforward, maybe it's just the pod, unless the pod's ports are related to services or something else.

This is a bit challenging. Let me try to outline possible steps:

Identify the sub-resource (e.g., pods/exec, deployments/scale).
Determine what other resources are involved when using this sub-resource. For example, exec accesses secrets via the pod's mounts.
For permission references, determine what permissions are needed on other resources when performing an operation on the sub-resource. Like create pods/exec requires get secrets.

So applying this to another sub-resource, say, deployments/rollback. The sub-resource is deployments/rollback (part of the extensions API). Creating a rollback would roll back the deployment to a previous revision. The resource reference would be deployments/rollback --> deployments (since it's modifying the deployment). For permission reference, creating a rollback would require update deployments, because rolling back changes the deployment's specification.

Wait, but in the examples, pods/eviction's permission is create pods/eviction --> delete pods. So maybe deployments/rollback would have create deployments/rollback --> update deployments.

Alternatively, since the rollback is a sub-resource, maybe it requires the update verb on deployments. So the permission reference would be create deployments/rollback --> update deployments.

Another example: daemonsets/status. Updating daemonsets/status affects the daemonset's status. So resource reference: daemonsets/status --> daemonsets. Permission reference: patch daemonsets/status --> patch daemonsets.

Wait, in the nodes/status example, the permission reference was patch nodes/status --> patch nodes. So similarly, patching daemonsets/status would require patch daemonsets.

Another sub-resource: podtemplates. Not sure. Maybe not. Let's think about networkpolicies. Maybe networkpolicies/status.

Alternatively, considering the /scale sub-resource for deployments. Deployments/scale would reference pods, similar to replicasets/scale. So resource reference: deployments/scale --> pods. Permission reference: updating deployments/scale would require create and delete pods, similar to replicasets/scale. So patch deployments/scale --> create pods, delete pods, etc.

So the key is to identify for each sub-resource:

What other resources does it reference? (Sub-Resource Reference)
What permissions on other resources are required when performing operations on the sub-resource? (Permission Reference)

Another example: leases in coordination.k8s.io. The lease resource has a sub-resource, maybe leases/status. Updating leases/status would reference the lease itself. So leases/status --> leases. Permission-wise, patch leases/status --> patch leases.

Another thought: custom resources might have sub-resources, but the user probably wants examples from core Kubernetes or common APIs.

Let me think of another example. The token sub-resource for serviceaccounts. For example, creating a token for a serviceaccount: serviceaccounts/token. Creating a token would reference the serviceaccount, so serviceaccounts/token --> serviceaccounts. Permission-wise, create serviceaccounts/token --> get serviceaccounts (to validate the SA exists) and maybe create secrets (if the token is stored as a secret). Wait, in Kubernetes, when you create a token request via the TokenRequest API, it doesn't create a secret by default unless bound to a Secret. But maybe the permission reference is create serviceaccounts/token --> create secrets, if the token is to be stored as a secret. Alternatively, if it's just generating a token, maybe it requires create on serviceaccounts/token and no other resources. But according to the examples, if the sub-resource operation affects another resource, then the permission reference is needed. So if creating a token via serviceaccounts/token creates a secret, then create serviceaccounts/token --> create secrets.

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the TokenRequest API doesn't create secrets by default. So perhaps the resource reference is just serviceaccounts/token --> serviceaccounts, and the permission reference is create serviceaccounts/token --> create serviceaccounts/token (no other permissions). But this might not fit the examples given. Alternatively, maybe the token is tied to the serviceaccount, so only needing get on serviceaccounts. Hmm.

Alternatively, considering the example of pods/exec requiring get secrets, because the pod has secrets mounted. So if a serviceaccount's token is being created, maybe it doesn't directly reference another resource, unless it's bound to a secret. This is getting a bit unclear. Maybe better to stick to more straightforward examples.

Another example: configmaps/status. Updating configmaps/status would reference the configmap. So resource reference: configmaps/status --> configmaps. Permission reference: patch configmaps/status --> patch configmaps.

Alright, I think I have a handle on the process. Now, if presented with a specific sub-resource, I can analyze it step by step following these patterns.
yes

Prompt: Please make the API Sub-Resource Reference analysis of certificatesigningrequests/approval. Just list the final results such as 'certificatesigningrequests/approval --> otherRes', without explanation.

Answer: 
Thinking...
Okay, I need to analyze the API Sub-Resource Reference for certificatesigningrequests/approval.

First, I remember that the approval sub-resource is used to approve or deny a CertificateSigningRequest (CSR) in Kubernetes. When someone approves a CSR, they're updating its status to be approved. This action directly affects the CSR itself because the approval is part of the CSR's status.

Looking at the examples given earlier, like pods/eviction --> pods, where the sub-resource affects the parent resource. Similarly, nodes/status --> nodes because updating the status affects the node resource.

So for certificatesigningrequests/approval, the main resource it references is the certificatesigningrequests resource itself. There's no mention of it affecting other resources besides the CSR. The approval modifies the CSR's status, so the reference should be certificatesigningrequests/approval --> certificatesigningrequests.

I don't see any other resources involved here. The approval doesn't create or modify secrets, pods, or others directly; it just changes the CSR's state. Therefore, the final result should be a single reference to certificatesigningrequests.
certificatesigningrequests/approval --> certificatesigningrequests

Prompt: Review your answer against the initial definitions:  
1. Did you avoid introducing unrelated resources?
Answer "Pass" if compliant, or "Fail: [reason]" if not.
If the answer is fail, please correct the result.

Answer: 
Thinking...
Okay, let's check if my answer for certificatesigningrequests/approval meets the initial definitions.

The user asked for API Sub-Resource Reference analysis, which looks at relationships between the sub-resource and other resources. In the example given, like pods/eviction --> pods, the sub-resource affects the main resource.

My answer was certificatesigningrequests/approval --> certificatesigningrequests. That's correct because approving a CSR modifies the CSR's status, which is part of the CSR resource. No other resources like secrets or pods are involved here.

I didn't introduce any unrelated resources. The analysis correctly links the sub-resource to its parent resource. So the answer passes.
Pass

Prompt: The verbs supported by certificatesigningrequests/approval resource include: [Get Update Patch]
Based on the verb obtained above, please make the subresource permission reference analysis of certificatesigningrequests/approval. Just list the results of permission reference, such as 'verb certificatesigningrequests/approval --> create B', without explanation.

Answer: 
Thinking...
Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants the permission reference analysis for certificatesigningrequests/approval, given that the supported verbs are Get, Update, and Patch.

First, I need to recall the examples from earlier. For instance, when you update a sub-resource like nodes/status, the permission reference was patch nodes/status --> patch nodes. Similarly, replicasets/scale's update required create and delete pods.

So, for certificatesigningrequests/approval, the verbs are Get, Update, Patch. The Get verb on the approval sub-resource would likely require Get on certificatesigningrequests, since you need to retrieve the approval status. But according to initial examples, maybe Get on the sub-resource doesn't require another permission beyond the sub-resource itself. Wait, in the examples, pods/exec required Get secrets because of mounted secrets, but here, getting the approval might just require access to the sub-resource.

However, looking at the nodes/status example, patching nodes/status required patch nodes. Similarly, updating certificatesigningrequests/approval (which is part of the CSR's status) would require permissions on the main CSR resource. So:

Update certificatesigningrequests/approval would map to Update on certificatesigningrequests (since approval is part of the CSR's status).

Same with Patch: Patch certificatesigningrequests/approval --> Patch certificatesigningrequests.

Get on the sub-resource would require Get on certificatesigningrequests, but in the initial examples, it's possible that Get on the sub-resource might not require an additional permission beyond Get on the sub-resource itself. But looking at the examples provided by the user, the permission references only linked actions that affect other resources. For example, create pods/eviction required delete pod. So maybe for Get, it's just Get on the sub-resource, but according to the user's initial examples, they didn't include Get in the permission references. Wait, in the examples, the first one was create pods/exec --> get secrets. So here, Get certificatesigningrequests/approval would need Get certificatesigningrequests.

Wait, the user's definition says permission references are how operations on the sub-resources might affect other resources. For Get, maybe just Get on the sub-resource itself. But the example given for pods/exec was create requiring get secrets. However, in the case of Get on certificatesigningrequests/approval, it's just retrieving the approval status, which is part of the CSR. Therefore, Get certificatesigningrequests/approval would require Get certificatesigningrequests (since the approval is part of the CSR's status). Similarly, Update and Patch would require Update and Patch on the CSR itself.

So the permissions would be:

get certificatesigningrequests/approval --> get certificatesigningrequests
update certificatesigningrequests/approval --> update certificatesigningrequests
patch certificatesigningrequests/approval --> patch certificatesigningrequests

Yes, that aligns with the nodes/status example where patching the status required patching the node resource.
get certificatesigningrequests/approval --> get certificatesigningrequests
update certificatesigningrequests/approval --> update certificatesigningrequests
patch certificatesigningrequests/approval --> patch certificatesigningrequests

Prompt: Review your answer against the initial definitions:
1. Did you avoid introducing unrelated permission references?  
Answer "Pass" if compliant, or "Fail: [reason]" if not.
If the answer is fail, please correct the result.

Answer: 
Thinking...
Okay, let's check my answer against the initial definitions.

The user's examples for permission references show that operations on sub-resources require permissions on related resources. For example, create pods/exec requires get secrets, and update replicasets/scale requires create/delete pods.

In my answer for certificatesigningrequests/approval, I mapped the verbs (get, update, patch) on the sub-resource to the same verbs on the main certificatesigningrequests resource. This follows the pattern seen in the nodes/status example, where patch nodes/status required patch nodes.

There are no additional permissions introduced beyond what's necessary. Each sub-resource verb directly maps to the corresponding verb on the parent resource without involving unrelated resources like secrets or pods. Therefore, the answer complies with the initial definitions and avoids introducing unrelated permissions.

Pass
