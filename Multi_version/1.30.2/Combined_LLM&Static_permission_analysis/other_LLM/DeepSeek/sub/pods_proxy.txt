Prompt: As a Kubernetes expert, specializing in identifying API Sub-Resource reference and API Sub-Resource Permission Reference. Your task is to make the sub-resource reference analysis and sub-resource permission reference analysis.
Regarding the API Sub-Resource Reference analysis, it is defined as follows: In the context of Kubernetes, sub-resource reference analysis can be understood as analyzing the relationship between sub-resources and other resources. Below are some examples:
1. For pods/exec, creating pods/exec can execute commands in Pod, and secrets is mounted in pod, so there are the following resource reference: pods/exec --> secrets.
2. For pods/eviction, creating pods/eviction can expel the specified pod, so there are the following resource reference: pods/eviction --> pods.
3. For replicasets/scale, updating replicasets/scale can update the number of pods, so there are the following resource reference: replicasets/scale --> pods.
4. For nodes/status, updating nodes/status can update the status field of node, so there are the following resource reference: nodes/status --> nodes.
5. For statefulsets/scale, updating statefulsets/scale can update the number of pods, so there are the following resource reference: statefulsets/scale --> pods.
Regarding the API Sub-Resource Permission Reference analysis, it is defined as follows: In the context of Kubernetes, sub-resource permission reference analysis can be understood as analyzing how operations on sub-resources might affect other API resources or trigger operations on other API resources. Below are some examples:
1. For pod/exec, creating pods/exec can access the terminal session of a pod and access the contents of secrets mounted in the pod. Therefore, it can be concluded: create pods/exec --> get secrets.
2. For pods/eviction, creating pods/eviction can delete the specified pod. Therefore, it can be concluded: create pods/eviction --> delete pod.
3. For replicasets/scale, patching or updating replicasets/scale can adjust the number of Pods managed by the ReplicaSets, thereby increasing or decreasing the number of Pod resources. Therefore, it can be concluded: patch replicasets/scale --> create Pod, update replicasets/scale --> create Pod, patch replicasets/scale --> delete Pod, update replicasets/scale --> delete Pod.
4. For nodes/status, patching or updating nodes/status can affect the status of Nodes. Therefore, it can be concluded: patch nodes/status --> patch nodes, update nodes/status --> update nodes.
5. For statefulsets/scale, patching or updating statefulsets/scale can adjust the number of Pods managed by the StatefulSets, thereby increasing or decreasing the number of Pod resources. Therefore, it can be concluded: patch statefulsets/scale --> create Pod, update statefulsets/scale --> create Pod, patch statefulsets/scale --> delete Pod, update statefulsets/scale --> delete Pod.
Do you understand the above concepts, and are you ready to start the analysis? Answer yes or no.

Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to act as a Kubernetes expert focusing on two types of analyses: Sub-Resource Reference and Sub-Resource Permission Reference. They provided examples, so I need to follow those patterns.

First, for the API Sub-Resource Reference analysis, I need to identify how a sub-resource relates to another resource. For instance, pods/exec references secrets because secrets are mounted in the pod. So, the format is sub-resource --> target resource.

Then, the Permission Reference analysis looks at how operations on the sub-resource affect other resources. Like create pods/exec requiring get access to secrets. The verbs here are important—create, update, patch, delete on the sub-resource translate to certain verbs on other resources.

I should check if I understand each example correctly. Let's see:

pods/exec: Creating it allows executing commands in a pod, which has secrets mounted. So, reference is pods/exec --> secrets. Permission-wise, creating pods/exec needs get on secrets.
pods/eviction: Creating it deletes a pod, so reference is pods/eviction --> pods. Permission is create on eviction leading to delete on pods.
Replicasets/scale affects the number of pods. Updating it references pods. Permission-wise, updating scale leads to create/delete pods.

Now, the user asked if I understand and am ready. They want a yes/no answer. But maybe they want to proceed with actual analyses next. But according to their last instruction, just answer yes or no. So I should respond "yes" to confirm understanding.
yes

Prompt: Please make the API Sub-Resource Reference analysis of pods/proxy. Just list the final results such as 'pods/proxy --> otherRes', without explanation.

Answer:

Okay, the user is asking for an API Sub-Resource Reference analysis of pods/proxy. They want the final results in the format like 'pods/proxy --> otherRes' without explanations.

First, I need to recall what the pods/proxy sub-resource does. The pods/proxy is used to proxy requests to pods. When you access this sub-resource, it essentially allows you to communicate with the pod's endpoints directly through the API server.

Now, according to the reference analysis examples given earlier, like pods/exec --> secrets because secrets are mounted in the pod, I need to determine what resources pods/proxy relates to. Accessing pods/proxy might require knowledge of the pod's network, but does it directly reference another resource?

Wait, maybe it's the pod itself. Proxying to a pod would require the existence of the pod. So the reference would be pods/proxy --> pods. But are there other resources involved? For example, if the pod is using a service account, maybe that's a stretch. The examples given in the original task mainly had direct relationships. Since the proxy action is directly interacting with the pod, the primary resource reference should be the pod itself. So the result should be 'pods/proxy --> pods'.

I don't think there's any other resource directly referenced here. The examples like exec referenced secrets because they were mounted, but proxy doesn't involve secrets unless the pod's service has TLS certs stored in secrets, but that's probably indirect. The direct reference is to the pod. So the answer should be pods/proxy --> pods.
pods/proxy --> pods

Alright, let's check if my previous answer for pods/proxy --> pods complies with the user's initial definitions. The user wants to ensure I didn't introduce unrelated resources.

The initial examples for Sub-Resource Reference Analysis linked sub-resources directly to other resources they affect or interact with. For instance, pods/exec --> secrets because secrets are mounted in the pod. Similarly, pods/proxy is used to proxy requests to a pod. Since proxying directly interacts with the pod itself, the reference to pods makes sense. There's no indication that pods/proxy involves other resources like services or secrets directly. The examples given in the problem statement don't include indirect relationships. Hence, linking pods/proxy to pods is appropriate and doesn't introduce unrelated resources.

Answer: Pass
Pass

Prompt: The verbs supported by pods/proxy resource include: [Get Create Update Patch Delete]
Based on the verb obtained above, please make the subresource permission reference analysis of pods/proxy. Just list the results of permission reference, such as 'verb pods/proxy --> create B', without explanation.

Answer: 
Thinking...
Okay, let's tackle the subresource permission reference analysis for pods/proxy. The verbs supported are Get, Create, Update, Patch, Delete.

First, for each verb, I need to determine what permissions they translate to on other resources. Let's start with Get. Accessing pods/proxy via Get allows the user to proxy requests to the pod. This doesn't create or modify other resources directly, but it might require read access to the pod's data. However, in the initial examples, pods/exec's Create verb required Get on secrets. Similarly, for Get pods/proxy, maybe it requires Get on pods to access the pod's information to proxy the request.

For Create, does creating a proxy session imply any action on pods? Maybe not directly creating a pod, but perhaps needing create permission on pods to establish the proxy. Wait, but the examples show that Create pods/exec leads to Get secrets. Maybe here, Create pods/proxy would need Create on pods? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the proxy operation is considered a get action on the pod's endpoints. Hmm.

Update and Patch verbs for pods/proxy would modify the proxy configuration. But how does that affect other resources? Maybe they require Update or Patch permissions on the pod itself or related services. But according to the initial examples, like nodes/status leading to patch nodes, maybe updating pods/proxy would require Update on pods.

Delete could relate to terminating a proxy session, which might require Delete permissions on pods, but that seems a stretch. Alternatively, maybe Delete isn't directly tied to another resource.

Looking back at the examples provided earlier: for pods/eviction, Create leads to Delete pod. For replicasets/scale, Update leads to Create/Delete Pods. So actions on the subresource map to specific verbs on related resources.

So for pods/proxy:

Get pods/proxy might require Get on pods to access the pod's data for proxying.
Create pods/proxy might require Create on pods, but perhaps it's more about accessing, so maybe Get on pods.
Wait, but in the case of pods/exec, Create required Get on secrets. So maybe Create here also needs Get on pods. But that's not matching the pattern. Alternatively, maybe Create pods/proxy allows creating a proxy session, which requires access to the pod, hence Get on pods.

Alternatively, maybe all verbs on pods/proxy require corresponding verbs on pods. For example, Get pods/proxy → Get pods, Create → Create pods, etc. But that might not be accurate. Proxying doesn't create a pod, but accesses it.

In the nodes/status example, updating nodes/status required Update on nodes. Similarly, maybe verbs on pods/proxy require the same verbs on pods. So:

Get pods/proxy → Get pods
Create pods/proxy → Create pods
Update → Update pods
Patch → Patch pods
Delete → Delete pods

But does proxying actually require those permissions? For example, getting a proxy doesn't require create on pods. Maybe the permissions are more about accessing the pod's network, which is part of the pod's status. Alternatively, perhaps it's that the proxy action requires the ability to read/write to the pod's endpoints, which might be tied to the pod resource's permissions.

Given the initial examples, especially nodes/status requiring Update nodes for patching status, it's plausible that verbs on pods/proxy correspond to the same verbs on pods. Therefore:

Each verb on pods/proxy (Get, Create, Update, Patch, Delete) maps to the same verb on pods.

Thus, the permission references would be:

get pods/proxy --> get pods
create pods/proxy --> create pods
update pods/proxy --> update pods
patch pods/proxy --> patch pods
delete pods/proxy --> delete pods

But I need to verify if this aligns with the examples. For instance, in the nodes/status example, updating nodes/status required update on nodes. Similarly, pods/proxy's verbs would map to the same verbs on pods. Hence, the final permissions are as above.
get pods/proxy --> get pods
create pods/proxy --> create pods
update pods/proxy --> update pods
patch pods/proxy --> patch pods
delete pods/proxy --> delete pods

Answer: 
Thinking...
Alright, let's review my previous answer against the initial definitions for permission references. The user wants to ensure that each verb on pods/proxy correctly maps to relevant permissions on other resources without introducing unrelated ones.

In the examples provided earlier:

pods/eviction create → delete pod
replicasets/scale update → create/delete pods
nodes/status patch/update → patch/update nodes

These show that actions on sub-resources directly trigger specific verbs on related resources. For pods/proxy, the verbs are Get, Create, Update, Patch, Delete. My initial mapping was each verb on pods/proxy maps to the same verb on pods. But considering how proxies work:

get pods/proxy allows retrieving data through the pod, which aligns with get pods.
create pods/proxy might initiate a proxy session, which doesn’t actually create a pod. The example for pods/exec create required get secrets, not create. So create pods/proxy might require get pods instead of create.
update/patch/delete pods/proxy actions modify proxy settings, which don’t directly update/delete the pod itself. These might not map to pod permissions, making them unrelated.

Thus, mapping all verbs to pods introduces incorrect permissions. Only get pods/proxy → get pods is valid. Others are unrelated, so the answer fails. Correction: Only include get pods/proxy → get pods.
Fail: The permissions "create pods/proxy --> create pods", "update pods/proxy --> update pods", "patch pods/proxy --> patch pods", and "delete pods/proxy --> delete pods" incorrectly imply that these verbs modify the pod resource itself, which is not accurate. Proxying operations (via pods/proxy) do not directly create, update, patch, or delete the underlying pod resource. These verbs relate to proxy-specific actions (e.g., establishing or modifying proxy connections) and do not map to equivalent operations on the pod. Only "get pods/proxy --> get pods" is valid, as retrieving a proxy session requires read access to the pod.
Corrected Result
get pods/proxy --> get pods
