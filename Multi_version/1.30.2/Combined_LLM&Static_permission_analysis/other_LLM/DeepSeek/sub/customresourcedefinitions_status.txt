Prompt: As a Kubernetes expert, specializing in identifying API Sub-Resource reference and API Sub-Resource Permission Reference. Your task is to make the sub-resource reference analysis and sub-resource permission reference analysis.
Regarding the API Sub-Resource Reference analysis, it is defined as follows: In the context of Kubernetes, sub-resource reference analysis can be understood as analyzing the relationship between sub-resources and other resources. Below are some examples:
1. For pods/exec, creating pods/exec can execute commands in Pod, and secrets is mounted in pod, so there are the following resource reference: pods/exec --> secrets.
2. For pods/eviction, creating pods/eviction can expel the specified pod, so there are the following resource reference: pods/eviction --> pods.
3. For replicasets/scale, updating replicasets/scale can update the number of pods, so there are the following resource reference: replicasets/scale --> pods.
4. For nodes/status, updating nodes/status can update the status field of node, so there are the following resource reference: nodes/status --> nodes.
5. For statefulsets/scale, updating statefulsets/scale can update the number of pods, so there are the following resource reference: statefulsets/scale --> pods.
Regarding the API Sub-Resource Permission Reference analysis, it is defined as follows: In the context of Kubernetes, sub-resource permission reference analysis can be understood as analyzing how operations on sub-resources might affect other API resources or trigger operations on other API resources. Below are some examples:
1. For pod/exec, creating pods/exec can access the terminal session of a pod and access the contents of secrets mounted in the pod. Therefore, it can be concluded: create pods/exec --> get secrets.
2. For pods/eviction, creating pods/eviction can delete the specified pod. Therefore, it can be concluded: create pods/eviction --> delete pod.
3. For replicasets/scale, patching or updating replicasets/scale can adjust the number of Pods managed by the ReplicaSets, thereby increasing or decreasing the number of Pod resources. Therefore, it can be concluded: patch replicasets/scale --> create Pod, update replicasets/scale --> create Pod, patch replicasets/scale --> delete Pod, update replicasets/scale --> delete Pod.
4. For nodes/status, patching or updating nodes/status can affect the status of Nodes. Therefore, it can be concluded: patch nodes/status --> patch nodes, update nodes/status --> update nodes.
5. For statefulsets/scale, patching or updating statefulsets/scale can adjust the number of Pods managed by the StatefulSets, thereby increasing or decreasing the number of Pod resources. Therefore, it can be concluded: patch statefulsets/scale --> create Pod, update statefulsets/scale --> create Pod, patch statefulsets/scale --> delete Pod, update statefulsets/scale --> delete Pod.
Do you understand the above concepts, and are you ready to start the analysis? Answer yes or no.

Answer: 
Thinking...
Okay, so I need to analyze the API sub-resource reference and permission reference for Kubernetes. Let me start by recalling the examples given.

For the resource reference, it's about how a sub-resource relates to other resources. Like pods/exec referencing secrets because secrets are mounted in the pod. Then pods/eviction references pods because evicting a pod affects the pod itself. Similarly, scaling sub-resources like replicasets/scale affect pods by changing their count.

For the permission reference, it's about the operations on the sub-resource leading to operations on other resources. For example, creating pods/exec requires get access to secrets. Creating evictions requires delete on pods. Updating scale resources can create or delete pods.

Now, let's think of another sub-resource. Maybe deployments/scale. Since scaling a deployment changes the number of replicas, which in turn affects pods. So the resource reference would be deployments/scale --> pods. For the permission reference, updating deployments/scale would require create and delete pods, similar to replicasets.

Another example could be daemonsets/status. Updating the status of a daemonset might affect the daemonset itself, so daemonsets/status --> daemonsets. For permissions, patching daemonsets/status would need patch daemonsets.

Wait, but what about something like services/status? Updating the status might relate to the service resource. So services/status --> services. Permission-wise, updating services/status would need update services.

Or maybe podtemplates. Hmm, not sure. Let me check the examples again. The key is to map the sub-resource to the main resource or other resources it affects. Like how nodes/status affects nodes. So each sub-resource's effect on other resources.

Also, for permissions, when you perform an action on the sub-resource, what API operations does that translate to on other resources. Like creating an eviction is essentially deleting a pod, so you need delete pod permission.

Another possible sub-resource is roles/bindings, but maybe that's not a standard sub-resource. Alternatively, considering pod logs as a sub-resource. Accessing pod/logs would require get access to pods, I think. So pods/logs --> pods for resource reference, and get pods/logs --> get pods for permissions.

Wait, but the examples given for resource references are when the sub-resource affects another resource. Pods/exec affects secrets because secrets are mounted. Pods/eviction affects pods. So for pods/logs, maybe the reference is to pods, but the permission would be get pods.

So, resource reference analysis for pods/logs would be pods/logs --> pods because it's accessing the logs of a pod. Permission reference would be get pods/logs --> get pods.

Another example: endpoints/restricted. Not sure. Maybe endpoints is a resource, but I need to think of standard sub-resources. Like leases in coordination.k8s.io. Leases might not have a sub-resource. Maybe something like cronjobs/status. Updating cronjobs/status would reference cronjobs, and permission-wise, it would require update cronjobs.

Wait, the examples given for permission references often involve creating, updating, patching, or deleting. So for each sub-resource operation, determine which operations on other resources are needed.

Let me think about the horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA). The HPA interacts with scale sub-resources. But the HPA itself is a separate resource. However, when the HPA adjusts the scale, it's modifying the scale sub-resource of a deployment or replicaset. So maybe in that case, the HPA's permissions would need to update the scale sub-resource. But that's more about the HPA's permissions rather than the sub-resource's own permission reference.

Alternatively, considering the scale sub-resource for deployments. If I update deployments/scale, that affects the number of pods. So resource reference: deployments/scale --> pods. Permission reference: update deployments/scale --> create and delete pods, similar to replicasets/scale.

Another example: binding pods to nodes. Creating a binding involves the pods/binding sub-resource. When you create a pods/binding, you're assigning a pod to a node. So the resource reference would be pods/binding --> nodes, because it's binding the pod to a node. For permissions, creating pods/binding would require update nodes, maybe? Or perhaps create on pods/binding requires update on pods, since the pod's nodeName field is set. Wait, the pod's spec is modified to assign it to a node. So maybe the permission reference is create pods/binding --> update pods. Because binding a pod modifies the pod's node assignment. But the example given for eviction was create pods/eviction --> delete pod. So similarly, creating a pods/binding would update the pod's spec. So create pods/binding --> update pods. And the resource reference would be pods/binding --> pods, because it's modifying the pod itself.

Wait, but when you bind a pod to a node, the pod's nodeName is set. So the sub-resource pods/binding affects the pod's attributes. Therefore, the resource reference is pods/binding --> pods. Permission reference would be create pods/binding --> update pods.

Another example: podtemplates. Maybe podtemplates are a separate resource. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up resources and sub-resources. The key is to focus on sub-resources, which are accessed via the parent resource's API path. For example, /api/v1/namespaces/{namespace}/pods/{name}/exec is a sub-resource of pods.

So, to recap, for each sub-resource, determine:

Resource Reference: Which other resources are affected or referenced when using this sub-resource.
Permission Reference: What API operations on other resources are required when performing operations on the sub-resource.

Let me test another example. Let's take deployments/rollback. There's a sub-resource rollback which is used to rollback a deployment to a previous revision. The resource reference would be deployments/rollback --> deployments, since rolling back affects the deployment's configuration. For the permission reference, creating a rollback (if that's the operation) would require update on deployments, because it's changing the deployment's spec.

Alternatively, in the example of the rollback sub-resource, the operation might be POST on deployments/rollback, which would trigger the deployment controller to roll back. So the resource reference is deployments/rollback --> deployments. Permission reference: create deployments/rollback --> update deployments.

Another example: services/proxy. Accessing services/proxy allows proxying requests to the service. So this sub-resource would reference services, as it's part of the service's API. So resource reference: services/proxy --> services. For permissions, accessing services/proxy might require get access to services and possibly get access to pods if it's proxying to pods, but according to the examples, maybe it's just get services. But maybe using the proxy could involve accessing the pods behind the service. So perhaps services/proxy --> pods. But according to the examples given earlier, maybe the resource reference is services/proxy --> services because it's directly related. For permissions, if accessing services/proxy allows sending requests to pods, then maybe get services/proxy --> get pods. But I'm not sure. Maybe in Kubernetes, using the proxy sub-resource requires permissions on the service itself. The example for pods/exec required get secrets because the pod mounts secrets. Similarly, services/proxy might not directly reference pods unless the proxy action sends traffic to pods, but perhaps the resource reference is only to services. The permission reference might be get services/proxy --> get services. Hmm, I'm a bit uncertain here. Maybe better to stick with examples that are more clear.

Alternatively, considering the token sub-resource for service accounts. The serviceaccounts/token sub-resource is used to create tokens. So creating a token would reference the service account, and perhaps secrets because tokens are stored as secrets. So resource reference: serviceaccounts/token --> secrets. Permission reference: create serviceaccounts/token --> create secrets. But I'm not sure if that's accurate. When you create a token for a service account, Kubernetes creates a secret that holds the token. So creating serviceaccounts/token would result in a secret being created. Therefore, the permission reference would be create serviceaccounts/token --> create secrets. And the resource reference would be serviceaccounts/token --> secrets.

But in the examples given earlier, pods/exec --> secrets because secrets are mounted. Similarly, serviceaccounts/token creates secrets, so serviceaccounts/token --> secrets. For permission reference, creating the token sub-resource would need create on secrets. So create serviceaccounts/token --> create secrets.

Another example: nodes/proxy. Accessing nodes/proxy allows proxying requests to nodes. So the resource reference would be nodes/proxy --> nodes. Permission reference: get nodes/proxy --> get nodes. But if proxying to the node's kubelet might require additional permissions on pods, but perhaps not directly. Maybe just referencing nodes.

This is getting a bit complicated, but I think with the examples provided earlier, I can model other sub-resources similarly. The key is to see how the sub-resource's operation affects other resources, either by modifying them, creating them, or accessing their data (like mounted secrets).
Yes.

Prompt: Please make the API Sub-Resource Reference analysis of customresourcedefinitions/status. Just list the final results such as 'customresourcedefinitions/status --> otherRes', without explanation.

Answer: 
Thinking...
Okay, the user is asking specifically about the API Sub-Resource Reference analysis for customresourcedefinitions/status. They want just the final result in the format mentioned.

First, I need to recall what customresourcedefinitions (CRDs) are. CRDs are used to define custom resources in Kubernetes. The status sub-resource here would be used to update the status of a CRD.

Looking at the examples given earlier, like nodes/status --> nodes, updating a status sub-resource affects the main resource. So for CRDs, updating customresourcedefinitions/status would update the status section of the CRD itself. Therefore, the resource reference should be customresourcedefinitions/status --> customresourcedefinitions.

The permission reference analysis wasn't requested here, so I don't need to include that. The user only wants the API Sub-Resource Reference result. So the answer should be straightforward.
customresourcedefinitions/status --> customresourcedefinitions

Prompt: Review your answer against the initial definitions:  
1. Did you avoid introducing unrelated resources?
Answer "Pass" if compliant, or "Fail: [reason]" if not.
If the answer is fail, please correct the result.

Answer: 
Thinking...
Alright, let's break this down. The user asked me to check if my previous answer about customresourcedefinitions/status complies with their initial definitions. Specifically, they want to know if I introduced any unrelated resources.

Looking back at the initial examples, like nodes/status --> nodes, the pattern is that the status sub-resource references its parent resource. For customresourcedefinitions/status, the parent is customresourcedefinitions. My answer was customresourcedefinitions/status --> customresourcedefinitions, which follows exactly the same structure. No other resources are involved here. The user's examples don't show status sub-resources pointing to anything other than their own kind. So, I didn't add any unrelated resources. That means my answer passes their check.
Pass

Prompt: The verbs supported by customresourcedefinitions/status resource include: [Get Update Patch]
Based on the verb obtained above, please make the subresource permission reference analysis of customresourcedefinitions/status. Just list the results of permission reference, such as 'verb customresourcedefinitions/status --> create B', without explanation.

Answer: 
Thinking...
Okay, let's tackle this step by step.

The user wants a permission reference analysis for customresourcedefinitions/status, considering the supported verbs: Get, Update, Patch.

First, recalling the initial examples like nodes/status, where updating the status required permissions to patch or update the node itself. Similarly, since customresourcedefinitions/status is a sub-resource of customresourcedefinitions, operations on it would map to the same operations on the parent resource.

For the verbs:

Get on customresourcedefinitions/status would need get on customresourcedefinitions.
Update on the sub-resource maps to update on the parent.
Patch on the sub-resource maps to patch on the parent.

So the permissions required would be each verb on the sub-resource translating to the same verb on the main resource. No other resources are involved here, just the CRD itself. Thus, the results are straightforward.
get customresourcedefinitions/status --> get customresourcedefinitions
update customresourcedefinitions/status --> update customresourcedefinitions
patch customresourcedefinitions/status --> patch customresourcedefinitions

Prompt: Review your answer against the initial definitions:
1. Did you avoid introducing unrelated permission references?  
Answer "Pass" if compliant, or "Fail: [reason]" if not.
If the answer is fail, please correct the result.

Answer: 
Thinking...
Okay, let's check if my answer fits the initial definitions.

The user provided examples like nodes/status: patching it requires patch nodes. Similarly, for customresourcedefinitions/status, the verbs are get, update, patch. My answer mapped each verb directly to the same verb on the parent resource (customresourcedefinitions). No other resources or operations were mentioned. The examples show a direct 1:1 mapping (e.g., patch nodes/status → patch nodes). I followed the same pattern, so it's compliant. No unrelated permissions were introduced.

Pass.
