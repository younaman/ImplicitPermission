Prompt: As a Kubernetes expert, specializing in identifying API Sub-Resource reference and API Sub-Resource Permission Reference. Your task is to make the sub-resource reference analysis and sub-resource permission reference analysis.
Regarding the API Sub-Resource Reference analysis, it is defined as follows: In the context of Kubernetes, sub-resource reference analysis can be understood as analyzing the relationship between sub-resources and other resources. Below are some examples:
1. For pods/exec, creating pods/exec can execute commands in Pod, and secrets is mounted in pod, so there are the following resource reference: pods/exec --> secrets.
2. For pods/eviction, creating pods/eviction can expel the specified pod, so there are the following resource reference: pods/eviction --> pods.
3. For replicasets/scale, updating replicasets/scale can update the number of pods, so there are the following resource reference: replicasets/scale --> pods.
4. For nodes/status, updating nodes/status can update the status field of node, so there are the following resource reference: nodes/status --> nodes.
5. For statefulsets/scale, updating statefulsets/scale can update the number of pods, so there are the following resource reference: statefulsets/scale --> pods.
Regarding the API Sub-Resource Permission Reference analysis, it is defined as follows: In the context of Kubernetes, sub-resource permission reference analysis can be understood as analyzing how operations on sub-resources might affect other API resources or trigger operations on other API resources. Below are some examples:
1. For pod/exec, creating pods/exec can access the terminal session of a pod and access the contents of secrets mounted in the pod. Therefore, it can be concluded: create pods/exec --> get secrets.
2. For pods/eviction, creating pods/eviction can delete the specified pod. Therefore, it can be concluded: create pods/eviction --> delete pod.
3. For replicasets/scale, patching or updating replicasets/scale can adjust the number of Pods managed by the ReplicaSets, thereby increasing or decreasing the number of Pod resources. Therefore, it can be concluded: patch replicasets/scale --> create Pod, update replicasets/scale --> create Pod, patch replicasets/scale --> delete Pod, update replicasets/scale --> delete Pod.
4. For nodes/status, patching or updating nodes/status can affect the status of Nodes. Therefore, it can be concluded: patch nodes/status --> patch nodes, update nodes/status --> update nodes.
5. For statefulsets/scale, patching or updating statefulsets/scale can adjust the number of Pods managed by the StatefulSets, thereby increasing or decreasing the number of Pod resources. Therefore, it can be concluded: patch statefulsets/scale --> create Pod, update statefulsets/scale --> create Pod, patch statefulsets/scale --> delete Pod, update statefulsets/scale --> delete Pod.
Do you understand the above concepts, and are you ready to start the analysis? Answer yes or no.

Answer: 
Thinking...
Okay, so I need to analyze both the API Sub-Resource Reference and the Permission Reference based on the examples given. Let me start by understanding the two tasks clearly.

First, the Sub-Resource Reference analysis is about identifying which resources a sub-resource refers to. For example, pods/exec references secrets because the pod might have secrets mounted. Similarly, pods/eviction references pods because evicting a pod affects the pod itself. So the pattern here seems to be: when you perform an action on a sub-resource, what other resources are involved or affected directly?

Then, the Permission Reference analysis is about understanding what permissions (like create, delete, patch) on the sub-resource translate to in terms of operations on other resources. For example, creating a pods/exec requires the ability to get secrets because the pod may have secrets mounted that are accessed during execution. Similarly, creating a pods/eviction requires delete permission on the pod itself.

Now, let's think about some other sub-resources in Kubernetes and apply these analyses. Let's take deployments/scale. When you update deployments/scale, you're changing the number of replicas, which in turn affects the number of pods. So for the Sub-Resource Reference, deployments/scale would reference pods. For the Permission Reference, updating deployments/scale would require create and delete permissions on pods since scaling up creates pods and scaling down deletes them.

Another example could be daemonsets/status. Updating the status of a daemonset would affect the daemonset itself, so the reference would be daemonsets/status --> daemonsets. For permissions, patching daemonsets/status would require patch permissions on daemonsets.

Wait, but in the examples given, nodes/status references nodes, and the permission is patch nodes/status --> patch nodes. So similar logic applies here. Similarly, statefulsets/scale references pods, and the permissions include create and delete pods when scaling.

What about something like pods/log? Accessing the logs of a pod. The sub-resource is pods/log. For the reference analysis, pods/log would reference pods because you need the pod to exist to get its logs. Maybe also secrets if the logs contain information from mounted secrets? But in the examples, pods/exec references secrets because the exec can access the secrets. Logs might not directly reference secrets unless the logs output secret data. But perhaps in the reference analysis, it's more about the explicit dependencies. Pods/log would need the pod to exist, so reference is pods/log --> pods. For permission reference, getting pods/log would require get access on pods, since you need to read the pod's logs. So get pods/log --> get pods.

Another example: serviceaccounts/token. Creating a token for a service account. The sub-resource is serviceaccounts/token. The reference here would be serviceaccounts/token --> serviceaccounts, since the token is tied to the service account. For permissions, creating a token might require create on serviceaccounts/token, but also maybe get on serviceaccounts to validate existence. But according to the examples, perhaps create serviceaccounts/token would require create on tokens (if that's a resource) or maybe create on serviceaccounts? Wait, in Kubernetes, serviceaccounts/token is a sub-resource used to create tokens, which are secrets. So when you create a service account token, it generates a secret. So maybe the reference is serviceaccounts/token --> secrets. For the permission reference, creating serviceaccounts/token would require create on secrets because it generates a secret resource. So create serviceaccounts/token --> create secrets. But the initial resource reference would be serviceaccounts/token --> secrets because creating the token results in a secret.

Let me check if this makes sense. In the examples, pods/exec --> secrets because secrets are mounted. Similarly, serviceaccounts/token creates a secret, so the reference is to secrets. For permission, creating serviceaccounts/token would need create on secrets.

Another example: podtemplates. Maybe not a sub-resource. Let's think of another one. Maybe leases in coordination.k8s.io. Updating a lease might affect the node's status, but perhaps that's stretching it. Alternatively, consider endpoints/restricted, but that's not standard.

Alternatively, consider roles and rolebindings in RBAC. But those are more about permissions rather than sub-resources.

Wait, perhaps looking at the Kubernetes API docs for sub-resources. Common sub-resources include status, scale, exec, log, eviction, binding, etc.

Another one: binding pods to nodes. The sub-resource is binding, but I think that's a legacy endpoint. For example, creating a binding for a pod (though typically done by the scheduler). So pods/binding. The reference would be pods/binding --> pods and nodes, since you're binding a pod to a node. The permission reference would be create pods/binding requires update on pods (to set the node name), so create pods/binding --> update pods.

Another example: certificatesigningrequests/approval. Approving a CSR affects the CSR's status. So the reference would be certificatesigningrequests/approval --> certificatesigningrequests. For permission, updating approval would require update on certificatesigningrequests, maybe specifically approve permission.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me stick to more standard sub-resources.

Take cronjobs/status. Updating the status would reference cronjobs. Permission-wise, patch cronjobs/status --> patch cronjobs.

For jobs/status, similar: jobs/status --> jobs, and patch jobs/status requires patch jobs.

Another example: persistentvolumeclaims/status. Updating the status references the PVC itself. So persistentvolumeclaims/status --> persistentvolumeclaims. Permission-wise, patch on the sub-resource would require patch on persistentvolumeclaims.

So the pattern seems to be that for status sub-resources, the reference is to the parent resource, and the permission is patch/update on the parent.

For scale sub-resources, the reference is to pods, and the permissions are create/delete pods.

For exec, it's referencing secrets (if mounted) and requiring get on secrets.

For eviction, reference to pods and requiring delete on pods.

So applying this to any given sub-resource:

Identify what the sub-resource does.
Determine which other resources are involved or affected.
For the reference analysis, link the sub-resource to those resources.
For permission analysis, determine which operations on the sub-resource lead to which operations on other resources, based on the effect.

Now, let's test this with a new example: deployments/rollback. There's a sub-resource rollback in extensions/v1beta1 for Deployments. Performing a rollback would revert the Deployment to a previous revision. The reference here would be deployments/rollback --> deployments (since it modifies the Deployment) and possibly replica sets (if rolling back affects the ReplicaSets). However, based on the examples, maybe it's just deployments/rollback --> deployments. For permissions, rolling back would require update on deployments, so maybe create deployments/rollback --> update deployments.

Alternatively, in the examples given, for pods/eviction, it's create pods/eviction --> delete pods. So for deployments/rollback, creating the rollback sub-resource would trigger an update on the deployment. So create deployments/rollback --> update deployments.

But I'm not sure if rollback is still a sub-resource in current versions. In newer APIs, rollback might be deprecated. But assuming it's a valid sub-resource, the analysis would follow.

Another example: podtemplates. Wait, maybe not. Let's think of something else.

How about horizontalpodautoscalers/status? Updating the status of an HPA would reference the HPA itself. So horizontalpodautoscalers/status --> horizontalpodautoscalers. For permissions, patching the status would require patch on horizontalpodautoscalers.

Another case: networkpolicies/status. Similar to others, status sub-resource references the parent, permissions to patch the parent.

So the key is to map each sub-resource to the resources it affects, both in terms of reference and required permissions.
Yes. Let's proceed with the analysis. Provide the specific sub-resource you want to analyze, and I will perform both the API Sub-Resource Reference and API Sub-Resource Permission Reference analyses based on the defined patterns.

Prompt: Please make the API Sub-Resource Reference analysis of pods/binding. Just list the final results such as 'pods/binding --> otherRes', without explanation.

Answer: 
Thinking...
Okay, the user is asking for the API Sub-Resource Reference analysis of pods/binding. They just want the final result in the format 'pods/binding --> otherRes' without any explanation.

First, I need to recall what pods/binding does. Pods/binding is a sub-resource used to bind a pod to a node, typically done by the scheduler. When you create a binding, you're specifying which node the pod should run on. The main resource involved here is the pod itself because binding affects the pod's node assignment. Additionally, the binding might reference the node since it's assigning the pod to a specific node.

Looking at the examples given earlier: pods/eviction references pods because evicting a pod affects the pod. Similarly, pods/binding would directly affect the pod by setting its node name. Additionally, since the binding is about assigning to a node, the node resource is also involved. However, in the examples provided, the references are direct. For instance, nodes/status references nodes. But in this case, binding a pod to a node affects both the pod and possibly the node's status (like allocated resources). But according to the initial examples, maybe it's more about the direct resource being modified.

In the user's examples, the references are direct. For example, pods/exec --> secrets because secrets are mounted. Here, pods/binding modifies the pod's spec to assign it to a node. So the primary reference would be pods/binding --> pods. But does it also reference nodes? Because the node is part of the binding. However, in the examples given, like pods/eviction --> pods, it's a direct reference. The eviction affects the pod, not the node. Similarly, binding affects the pod's node assignment. The node itself isn't modified, but the pod is. So the reference would be pods/binding --> pods.

Wait, but when you bind a pod to a node, you might need to check if the node exists. However, in the examples, the references are about the resources that are directly affected. For instance, when you create a pods/exec, it's the pod that's executing, but the reference is to secrets because the secrets are mounted. So even though the pod is the main resource, the reference is to secrets because they are accessed. In the case of binding, the pod is modified (its node assignment), but the node's status might not be directly modified through the API here. The node's status (like capacity) is managed separately. Therefore, the API Sub-Resource Reference for pods/binding would be to pods.

Another angle: when you create a binding, you're updating the pod's nodeName field. This doesn't require modifying the node resource itself. So the only resource directly involved is the pod. Hence, pods/binding --> pods.
pods/binding --> pods

Prompt: Review your answer against the initial definitions:  
1. Did you avoid introducing unrelated resources?
Answer "Pass" if compliant, or "Fail: [reason]" if not.
If the answer is fail, please correct the result.

Answer:

Alright, after reviewing the initial examples provided by the user, I need to check if my previous analysis for pods/binding aligns with the defined patterns. The user initially provided examples where sub-resources reference other resources they directly affect. For instance, pods/exec references secrets because the pod mounts secrets. Similarly, pods/eviction references pods as the eviction action directly deletes the pod.

In the case of pods/binding, the sub-resource is used to bind a pod to a node. The action directly updates the pod's node assignment (nodeName field), which modifies the pod itself. The node resource isn't directly modified or referenced through this API call. The examples given by the user don't include indirect references, like nodes in this scenario, unless there's a direct modification or dependency. Since binding affects only the pod by setting its node, the correct reference should be pods/binding --> pods, which matches the original pattern. Therefore, there are no unrelated resources introduced, and the answer complies with the user's definitions.

Prompt: The verbs supported by pods/binding resource include: [Create]
Based on the verb obtained above, please make the subresource permission reference analysis of pods/binding. Just list the results of permission reference, such as 'verb pods/binding --> create B', without explanation.

Answer: 
Thinking...
Okay, the user wants the permission reference analysis for pods/binding when using the Create verb.

From the initial examples, like pods/eviction's Create verb requiring Delete on pods, and pods/exec's Create needing Get on secrets, I need to see what action creating a pod binding leads to.

Creating a pod binding essentially sets the node for a pod, which is part of the pod's spec. In Kubernetes, binding a pod to a node updates the pod's nodeName field. So, the permission required would be the ability to update the pod's spec. Thus, the Create on pods/binding should map to Update on pods.

Checking the previous patterns: create pods/eviction --> delete pod. Similarly, create pods/binding would trigger an update on the pod. So, the result should be 'create pods/binding --> update pods'.
create pods/binding --> update pods
