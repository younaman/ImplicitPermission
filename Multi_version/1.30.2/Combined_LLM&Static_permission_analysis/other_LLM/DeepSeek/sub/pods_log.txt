Prompt: As a Kubernetes expert, specializing in identifying API Sub-Resource reference and API Sub-Resource Permission Reference. Your task is to make the sub-resource reference analysis and sub-resource permission reference analysis.
Regarding the API Sub-Resource Reference analysis, it is defined as follows: In the context of Kubernetes, sub-resource reference analysis can be understood as analyzing the relationship between sub-resources and other resources. Below are some examples:
1. For pods/exec, creating pods/exec can execute commands in Pod, and secrets is mounted in pod, so there are the following resource reference: pods/exec --> secrets.
2. For pods/eviction, creating pods/eviction can expel the specified pod, so there are the following resource reference: pods/eviction --> pods.
3. For replicasets/scale, updating replicasets/scale can update the number of pods, so there are the following resource reference: replicasets/scale --> pods.
4. For nodes/status, updating nodes/status can update the status field of node, so there are the following resource reference: nodes/status --> nodes.
5. For statefulsets/scale, updating statefulsets/scale can update the number of pods, so there are the following resource reference: statefulsets/scale --> pods.
Regarding the API Sub-Resource Permission Reference analysis, it is defined as follows: In the context of Kubernetes, sub-resource permission reference analysis can be understood as analyzing how operations on sub-resources might affect other API resources or trigger operations on other API resources. Below are some examples:
1. For pod/exec, creating pods/exec can access the terminal session of a pod and access the contents of secrets mounted in the pod. Therefore, it can be concluded: create pods/exec --> get secrets.
2. For pods/eviction, creating pods/eviction can delete the specified pod. Therefore, it can be concluded: create pods/eviction --> delete pod.
3. For replicasets/scale, patching or updating replicasets/scale can adjust the number of Pods managed by the ReplicaSets, thereby increasing or decreasing the number of Pod resources. Therefore, it can be concluded: patch replicasets/scale --> create Pod, update replicasets/scale --> create Pod, patch replicasets/scale --> delete Pod, update replicasets/scale --> delete Pod.
4. For nodes/status, patching or updating nodes/status can affect the status of Nodes. Therefore, it can be concluded: patch nodes/status --> patch nodes, update nodes/status --> update nodes.
5. For statefulsets/scale, patching or updating statefulsets/scale can adjust the number of Pods managed by the StatefulSets, thereby increasing or decreasing the number of Pod resources. Therefore, it can be concluded: patch statefulsets/scale --> create Pod, update statefulsets/scale --> create Pod, patch statefulsets/scale --> delete Pod, update statefulsets/scale --> delete Pod.
Do you understand the above concepts, and are you ready to start the analysis? Answer yes or no.

Okay, let's try to work through this problem. So, the user is asking me to act as a Kubernetes expert and perform two types of analyses: API Sub-Resource Reference and API Sub-Resource Permission Reference. The examples they provided help clarify what's expected.

First, I need to understand the difference between the two analyses. From the examples, the Sub-Resource Reference analysis seems to be about identifying which resources are directly affected or related when a sub-resource is used. For instance, pods/exec references secrets because the pod might have secrets mounted. The Permission Reference analysis is about the specific operations (like create, update) on the sub-resource leading to permissions on other resources. Like creating pods/exec requires get access to secrets.

Now, the user wants me to apply this to new examples. But since they haven't provided specific cases yet, maybe they'll ask me to analyze a particular sub-resource. However, since their initial question was just to confirm understanding, I should check if I got the concepts right.

Wait, in their initial message, they provided examples and then asked if I understand and am ready. The user's last line is "Answer yes or no." So they just want a confirmation. But in the thought process, I need to elaborate how I arrived at the answer.

So, in this case, the user is checking if I comprehend the task. The examples given are clear. For the reference analysis, it's about the relationship between the sub-resource and other resources. For permission reference, it's about the verbs (create, update, patch, delete) on the sub-resource leading to which verbs on other resources.

I think I understand. For instance, if a sub-resource like deployments/scale is updated, that would reference pods because scaling a deployment changes the number of pods. Similarly, the permission reference would be that updating deployments/scale requires create or delete pod permissions.

Therefore, when presented with a new sub-resource, I should identify the related resources it affects and the corresponding permissions needed. The key is to map the sub-resource's operations to their impact on other resources.

Yes, I believe I understand the task. The answer should be "yes".
yes

Prompt: Please make the API Sub-Resource Reference analysis of pods/log. Just list the final results such as 'pods/log --> otherRes', without explanation.

Answer: 
Thinking...
Okay, so the user is asking for the API Sub-Resource Reference analysis of pods/log. The task is to figure out which resources are referenced when using pods/log.

First, I recall that the pods/log sub-resource is used to retrieve the logs of a container in a pod. From the examples given earlier, like pods/exec referencing secrets because secrets are mounted in the pod, I need to see if there's a similar relationship here.

When you access pods/log, you're getting log data from the pod. The pod itself is the primary resource here. However, are there other resources involved? For example, maybe the logs are stored in volumes, which could be linked to persistentvolumeclaims or secrets if the logs are written there. But typically, logs are stored in the container's stdout/stderr, which are ephemeral unless a logging agent is collecting them. But in the standard Kubernetes setup, accessing logs via pods/log doesn't directly involve other resources like secrets or configmaps unless the pod is using them.

But according to the examples given, the reference is direct. For instance, pods/exec references secrets because the pod has secrets mounted. Similarly, pods/log might reference the pod itself since the logs are part of the pod's data. The examples like nodes/status reference nodes, so pods/log would likely reference pods. There's no indication in standard Kubernetes that pods/log interacts with other resources beyond the pod. So the result should be pods/log --> pods.
pods/log --> pods

Prompt: Review your answer against the initial definitions:  
1. Did you avoid introducing unrelated resources?
Answer "Pass" if compliant, or "Fail: [reason]" if not.
If the answer is fail, please correct the result.

Answer:

Okay, let's check if my answer for pods/log --> pods fits the initial definitions.

The user's initial examples for Sub-Resource Reference analysis linked the sub-resource to another resource it directly affects. For example, pods/exec --> secrets because secrets are mounted in the pod. Similarly, pods/log accesses the pod's logs, which are part of# 4th place solution for Google AI Open Images - Object Detection Track
The solution is based on Detectron and maskrcnn-benchmark.
We trained 4 models and ensemble their results.
The code is a little bit messy, but I will try to make it clearer.

Other common packages listed in requirements.txt

Pretrained models

You need to download the ImageNet pretrained models for Detectron and maskrcnn-benchmark.
Put them into data/pretrained_model and data/pretrained_model_maskrcnn_benchmark respectively.

The models we used in our solution can be downloaded from Google Drive.
After downloading, unzip them and put them into output folder.

Data preparation

Download Open Images Dataset v4, including images and annotations.
Organize them as following structure:

angelscript
 
open_images
|-- annotations
|   |-- class-descriptions-boxable.csv
|   |-- train-annotations-bbox.csv
|   |-- validation-annotations-bbox.csv
|   |-- test-annotations-bbox.csv
|-- images
|   |-- train_0
|   |-- train_1
|   |-- ...
|   |-- validation
|   |-- test

Then run python prepare_data.py to convert annotations into COCO format.

Testing

First, you need to setup maskrcnn-benchmark and add its path to PYTHONPATH.
Then run sh test.sh to generate the detection results.
The final result is generated by ensembling 4 models. You can also test them individually.
The final result will be saved in submission.csv.

Training

First, you need to setup Detectron and add its path to PYTHONPATH.
The config files are in the configs folder.
Take the model e2e_faster_rcnn_X-101-64x4d-FPN_2x_voc0712_plus_oi_with_abs as an example,
the training command is:

apache
 
python2 train/tools/train_net.py --cfg configs/e2e_faster_rcnn_X-101-64x4d-FPN_2x_voc0712_plus_oi_with_abs.yaml OUTPUT_DIR output/e2e_faster_rcnn_X-101-64x4d-FPN_2x_voc0712_plus_oi_with_abs

The model e2e_mask_rcnn_X-101-64x4d-FPN_2x_gn_oi is trained with maskrcnn-benchmark.
Use the config file in configs_benchmark/e2e_mask_rcnn_X_101_64x4d_FPN_2x_gn_oi.yaml and follow the instructions of maskrcnn-benchmark to train it.

Prompt: The verbs supported by pods/log resource include: [Get]
Based on the verb obtained above, please make the subresource permission reference analysis of pods/log. Just list the results of permission reference, such as 'verb pods/log --> create B', without explanation.

Answer:

get pods/log --> get pods

Prompt: Review your answer against the initial definitions:
1. Did you avoid introducing unrelated permission references?  
Answer "Pass" if compliant, or "Fail: [reason]" if not.
If the answer is fail, please correct the result.

Answer: 
Thinking...
Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to review my previous answer regarding the subresource permission reference analysis for pods/log.

In the initial examples provided, the permission references linked the verb on the sub-resource to a verb on another resource. For instance, creating pods/exec required getting secrets. Similarly, creating pods/eviction required deleting pods.

In my previous response, I concluded that "get pods/log --> get pods". Since getting the logs requires reading the pod's log data, the necessary permission would be the ability to get the pod itself. According to the initial definitions, this makes sense because accessing the logs (a sub-resource) would require access to the pod's data. The permission here is directly related and doesn't introduce any unrelated resources or verbs.

The user wants to ensure that I didn't include any unrelated permissions. Checking against the examples, the structure matches (verb sub-resource --> verb resource). There's no mention of other resources like secrets or nodes here, which aren't involved in accessing logs. Therefore, my answer should comply with the initial definitions.

Pass.
