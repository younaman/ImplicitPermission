Prompt: As a Kubernetes expert, specializing in identifying API Resource Reference Analysis and API Resource Permission Reference Analysis. Your task is to make the following two analyses of kubernetes api resources provided by users: 1. API Resource Reference Analysis: Analyze dependencies, interactions, and relationships among Kubernetes API resources. 2.API Resource Permission Reference Analysis: Analyze the influence relationship between permissions, that is, one permission may trigger another permission.
Regarding the API resource reference analysis, it is defined as follows: In the context of Kubernetes, API resource reference analysis can be understood as analyzing the dependencies and interactions among API resources within Kubernetes. API Resource reference can be divided into resource reference and resource reference. Below are some examples:
1. For the Node resource, its Spec.Taints field is related to the scheduling of Pod resources. The values of the Taint field affect the creation and deletion of Pod resources. Therefore, this is an example of resource reference: Node --> Pod.
2. For the Daemonset resource, its Spec.Template field determines the state of the Pods it manages. Therefore, it can be considered a resource reference: Daemonset --> Pod.
3. For the StatefulSet resource, its Spec.Template field determines the state of the Pod resources it manages. Modifying the content of this field will also cause corresponding changes in the associated Pods. Therefore, this is an example of resource reference: StatefulSet --> Pod.
4. For the Job resource, its Spec.Template field determines the state of the Pods it manages. Therefore, this is an example of resource reference: Job --> Pod.
5. For the ClusterRoleBinding resource, it can associate a ServiceAccount with a ClusterRole, thus creating a reference from ClusterRoleBinding to ClusterRole.
Regarding the API resource permission reference analysis, it is defined as follows: Based on API resource reference analysis, the analysis incorporates the resource's verb to further examine the feasibility of the reference as well as the specific content and functionality of the reference. Below are some examples:
1. For example 1 in the above resource reference, the permission reference analysis is as follows: Modifying the taint field of a Node resource can trigger the deletion of some specific Pods. From this, we can derive the permission reference: patch Node --> delete Pod, update Node --> delete Pod, etc.
2. For example 2 in the above resource reference, the permission reference analysis is as follows: Deleting Daemonset can lead to the deletion of corresponding Pod resources. From this, we can derive the permission reference: delete Daemonset --> delete Pod, deletecollection Daemonset --> delete Pod, etc.
3. For example 3 in the above resource reference, the permission reference analysis is as follows: Modifying the spec.template of StatefulSet resources can result in Modifying corresponding Pod resources, and modifying the spec.replicas of StatefulSet can result in creation and deletion the corresponding pod. From this, we can derive the permission reference: patch StatefulSet --> patch Pod, patch StatefulSet --> create Pod, patch StatefulSet --> delete Pod, update StatefulSet --> update Pod, etc.
4. For example 4 in the above resource reference, the permission reference analysis is as follows: Creating a Job resource can control the creation of Pod resources. From this, we can derive the permission reference: create Job --> create Pod, etc.
5. For example 5 in the above resource reference, the permission reference analysis is as follows: Creating a ClusterRoleBinding can bind a ClusterRole to a ServiceAccount. The cluster by default has the cluster-admin ClusterRole, which possesses all permissions. Therefore, the following permission reference can be derived: create ClusterRoleBinding --> * *.
Do you understand the above two concepts, and are you ready to start the analysis? Answer yes or no.

Answer: 
Thinking...
Okay, so I need to perform two types of analyses on Kubernetes API resources: API Resource Reference Analysis and API Resource Permission Reference Analysis. Let me start by recalling what each of these entails based on the user's description.

First, the API Resource Reference Analysis is about understanding dependencies and interactions between resources. For example, a Deployment references Pods through its PodTemplate. So modifying the Deployment's template affects the Pods. Similarly, Node's taints affect Pod scheduling. The key here is to identify which resources control or influence others, like how a DaemonSet or StatefulSet manages Pods.

Then, the Permission Reference Analysis builds on that by looking at how permissions on one resource can trigger permissions on another. For instance, having permission to create a Deployment might allow you to create Pods indirectly. Or updating a Node's taints could require delete Pod permissions because it might cause Pods to be evicted.

Let's take the example provided by the user. If a ClusterRoleBinding references a ClusterRole, creating a ClusterRoleBinding could grant the permissions of the ClusterRole to a user or service account. So if the ClusterRole has broad permissions, creating the binding effectively gives those permissions. Therefore, the permission reference here might be that creating a ClusterRoleBinding allows whatever the ClusterRole permits, hence the "create ClusterRoleBinding --> * *" example.

Now, I need to apply this to the given resource: ClusterIP Service. The user wants both analyses for this resource.

Starting with the API Resource Reference Analysis. A ClusterIP Service typically selects Pods using a selector defined in its spec.selector field. The Service uses this selector to find Pods with matching labels and routes traffic to them. So the Service references Pods via the selector. So the resource reference would be Service --> Pod.

Next, for the Permission Reference Analysis. The permissions required to create or modify a Service would affect the Pods it references. For example, creating a Service with a selector that matches certain Pods allows the Service to direct traffic to those Pods. However, does that require any permissions on the Pods themselves? Wait, actually, the Service doesn't create or modify Pods. It just selects Pods that already exist. So maybe the permission to create a Service doesn't directly require Pod permissions, but if a user can create a Service that points to Pods they don't own, could that be a security concern? Hmm, but in terms of Kubernetes permissions, the Service resource doesn't require permissions on Pods because it's the controller manager that handles the endpoints, not the user. Wait, the Endpoints object is automatically created by the Service, but the user creating the Service needs permissions to create the Service, not necessarily the Endpoints. However, in some cases, if a user has permission to create a Service, the system (like the endpoints controller) will create Endpoints objects based on the selector. But the user doesn't need explicit permissions on Endpoints. So maybe the permissions for the Service don't directly translate to permissions on Pods, unless the Service's configuration affects other resources.

Wait, but maybe if a Service's selector is changed, it could cause the Endpoints to update, which in turn affects which Pods are targeted. However, the user would need permissions to update the Service, but the actual Pods are just being selected based on labels. The user doesn't need Pod permissions unless they are creating Pods with certain labels. So perhaps the permission reference here is that creating/updating a Service allows influencing traffic to Pods, but doesn't directly require Pod permissions. However, if the Service's selector matches Pods that the user shouldn't have access to, that might be a concern, but it's more about label selection rather than explicit permissions.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. According to the examples given earlier, the main permission references are when an action on one resource causes an action on another. For example, creating a Deployment requires create Pod permissions because the Deployment controller will create Pods. Similarly, updating a Node's taints might require delete Pod permissions because it could evict Pods.

In the case of a Service, creating a Service doesn't directly create Pods. However, the Endpoints for the Service are automatically managed by the Endpoints controller, which watches Pods and Services. The user creating the Service needs permissions to create the Service resource, but not necessarily Pods. However, if the Service has a selector that matches Pods, the Endpoints will be populated, but that's done by the controller, not the user. Therefore, the user doesn't need Pod permissions to create a Service. So maybe there's no direct permission reference here. But wait, maybe if the Service is of type LoadBalancer and there's a cloud provider integration, that could create external resources, but that's outside the core Kubernetes resources.

Alternatively, if the Service uses a Pod's labels, the user might need permissions to create Pods with those labels to be part of the Service. But that's separate; the Service's existence doesn't require Pod permissions, but if a user can create Pods with certain labels, they can join them to existing Services. But that's not a permission reference from Service to Pod, but rather Pod to Service.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that the Service references Pods via the selector, but the permissions to create a Service don't directly translate to permissions on Pods. Therefore, there might not be a direct permission reference. However, if a user can create a Service that selects Pods from other namespaces (if the Service is in a namespace and the Pods are in another, which is possible with cross-namespace selectors), but by default, Services select Pods in the same namespace. So if a user can create a Service in a namespace, they can direct traffic to Pods in that namespace, but that doesn't require permissions on the Pods themselves. The Pods would have to be created by someone else with the right labels.

Alternatively, if a user can create a Service and also create Pods with labels that match the Service, then they can control which Pods are part of the Service. But that would require both create Service and create Pod permissions. The create Service permission alone doesn't grant Pod permissions, but combining them allows the user to set up Services for their Pods.

But according to the examples given earlier, the permission references are when an action on one resource inherently requires another action. For example, creating a Deployment requires create Pod because the Deployment controller will create Pods. Similarly, deleting a DaemonSet deletes Pods. In the case of Services, creating a Service doesn't create Pods, but it does create Endpoints. However, the Endpoints are managed by the controller, not the user. The user doesn't need permission to create Endpoints; the controller does that automatically. So maybe the permission reference here is that creating a Service requires create Endpoints? But the Endpoints are managed by the system, so the user doesn't need explicit permissions. Therefore, maybe there's no direct permission reference from Service to Pod, but perhaps to Endpoints.

Wait, when you create a Service, the Endpoints object is created automatically if you don't specify it. So the user creating the Service doesn't need permissions on Endpoints because the controller handles that. Therefore, there's no direct permission escalation here. So perhaps the answer is that there is a resource reference from Service to Pod (since the Service selects Pods), but no permission reference because the user doesn't need Pod permissions to create/update the Service.

However, let's consider updating a Service's selector. If a user updates the selector, the Endpoints controller will update the Endpoints to match the new Pods. But again, the user doesn't need Pod permissions; they just need update Service. The controller handles the rest. So the permission to update a Service allows influencing which Pods are included in the Endpoints, but doesn't require the user to have permissions on the Pods themselves.

Therefore, the resource reference is Service --> Pod because the Service's selector references Pods. For the permission reference, since the user doesn't directly create/delete Pods by modifying the Service, there might not be a direct permission trigger. However, in some cases, if the Service is part of a higher-level resource (like a Deployment), but the Service itself doesn't manage Pods. Wait, perhaps the correct analysis is that there is a resource reference from Service to Pod, but no permission reference because the Service doesn't cause Pods to be created or deleted. It just selects existing ones. Therefore, the permission to create/update a Service doesn't require any Pod permissions, so there's no permission reference.

But wait, the user's examples included Node --> Pod where modifying taints can cause Pod deletion. Similarly, maybe modifying a Service's selector could cause Pods to be included or excluded, but that doesn't delete or create Pods. So maybe there's no direct permission reference for Service to Pod. Therefore, the answer would be:

API Resource Reference Analysis: Service --> Pod (because the Service selects Pods via selector).

API Resource Permission Reference Analysis: Since the Service doesn't create or delete Pods, there's no direct permission trigger. However, if the user has permissions to create Services and Pods, they can control which Pods are part of the Service. But the permission reference would only exist if the action on one resource inherently requires another. Since creating a Service doesn't require Pod permissions, perhaps there's no permission reference here. But maybe in terms of the Endpoints, creating a Service leads to the creation of Endpoints, but the user doesn't need permissions on Endpoints. So maybe the answer is that there's no permission reference for Service to Pod.

But wait, in the user's examples, the ClusterRoleBinding example leads to a permission reference because creating a ClusterRoleBinding grants the permissions of the ClusterRole. So creating a ClusterRoleBinding that references a ClusterRole with high privileges effectively gives those privileges, hence the permission reference create ClusterRoleBinding --> * *.

Similarly, for a Service, if the Service is used by an Ingress or another resource that requires it, but that's a separate reference. However, the user's question is about the Service resource itself. So focusing on the Service, the main interaction is with Pods via selector, leading to the resource reference. For permissions, since the Service doesn't manage Pod lifecycles, there's no direct permission reference. But let's double-check.

Alternatively, if a user can create a Service, they can expose existing Pods. But that doesn't require Pod permissions. The Pods must already exist and have the right labels. So the user could create a Service that targets Pods they shouldn't have access to, but that's more about access control via labels rather than Kubernetes RBAC permissions. Therefore, from a pure RBAC perspective, creating a Service doesn't require Pod permissions, so there's no permission reference.

Therefore, the conclusion would be:

API Resource Reference Analysis: Service --> Pod (via spec.selector).

API Resource Permission Reference Analysis: No direct permission references, since Service operations don't require Pod permissions. However, if the Service is part of another resource (like a Deployment), but standalone Service might not trigger any Pod permissions. But according to the examples given, maybe there's no permission reference here.

Wait, but the examples included cases where modifying a resource (like Node's taints) leads to Pod deletions, which requires delete Pod permissions. Similarly, if a Service is deleted, does that affect Pods? No, the Pods remain. The Service just stops routing traffic. So deleting a Service doesn't delete Pods. Therefore, there's no permission reference for delete Service --> delete Pod.

Therefore, there's no permission reference here. So the answer would be:

API Resource Reference Analysis: Service references Pods via spec.selector, so Service --> Pod.

API Resource Permission Reference Analysis: No direct permission references from Service to Pod operations, as Service management doesn't create, update, or delete Pods. However, if a user can create a Service, they might influence network policies or ingress, but those are separate resources. So the permission reference analysis would conclude no direct permission triggers from Service to Pod.
API Resource Reference Analysis:
Service --> Pod: A ClusterIP Service references Pods through its spec.selector field, which determines the Pods to route traffic to. Changes to the selector update the Service's Endpoints, reflecting the current set of Pods with matching labels. This establishes a direct resource reference where the Service depends on Pods for traffic routing.
API Resource Permission Reference Analysis:
No direct permission references identified:
Modifying a Service (e.g., create, update, or delete Service) does not inherently trigger operations on Pods (e.g., Pod creation/deletion). The Service relies on the Endpoints controller to populate Endpoints based on Pod labels, but this is managed by the control plane, not user permissions. A user with Service permissions can influence traffic to Pods but does not require explicit Pod permissions (e.g., create Pod, delete Pod). Thus, there is no cascading permission relationship like those seen in controllers (e.g., Deployment → Pod).
Summary:
Resource Reference: Service → Pod (via spec.selector).
Permission Reference: None, as Service operations do not directly propagate permission requirements to Pods.

Prompt: Please make the API resource reference analysis of ingresses. Just list the final results such as 'ingresses --> otherRes', without explanation.

Answer: 
Thinking...
Okay, the user is asking for the API resource reference analysis of Ingresses and wants just the final results listed as 'ingresses --> otherRes' without any explanation. Let me recall the previous examples and the approach we took for the Service resource.

First, when analyzing the Service, we looked at how it references Pods via the selector. Now, for Ingress, I need to determine which resources it references.

An Ingress in Kubernetes is used to manage external access to services, typically HTTP/HTTPS. The Ingress spec usually references a Service. For example, in the Ingress manifest, there's a backend.service.name field that specifies the Service to route traffic to. So, the Ingress references the Service. Therefore, Ingress --> Service.

Additionally, some Ingress controllers support referencing Secrets, especially for TLS termination. The Ingress can specify a Secret in the tls.secretName field to provide TLS certificates. So, Ingress --> Secret.

If the Ingress uses annotations or rules that reference other resources like ConfigMaps (for configuration settings specific to the Ingress controller), but that might be implementation-specific. For example, some Ingress controllers like nginx use ConfigMaps to store configuration. However, the standard Ingress resource might not directly reference ConfigMaps unless specified in the spec. Since the user is asking for the general case, maybe only Service and Secret are standard references.

Another point: Ingress can also reference IngressClass via the spec.ingressClassName field, which determines which controller should handle the Ingress. So Ingress --> IngressClass.

Putting it all together, the resource references for Ingress would be:

Ingress --> Service
Ingress --> Secret
Ingress --> IngressClass

I should check if there are any other standard references. For example, does the Ingress reference any other resources like Endpoints? No, the Ingress typically routes to Services, which in turn route to Pods. So the direct references are Service, Secret, and IngressClass.
ingresses --> service
ingresses --> secret
ingresses --> ingressclass

Prompt: Review your answer against the initial definitions:  
1. Did you avoid introducing unrelated resources?
Answer "Pass" if compliant, or "Fail: [reason]" if not.
If the answer is fail, please correct the result.

Answer: 
Thinking...
Alright, let's review my previous answer against the initial definitions to ensure compliance.

The user asked for an API resource reference analysis of Ingresses. My response listed:

ingresses --> service
ingresses --> secret
ingresses --> ingressclass

Initial Definitions Check:
The examples provided earlier (e.g., Deployment→Pod, Node→Pod) focus on direct dependencies where one resource controls or directly influences another's state.

Ingress --> Service: Valid. Ingress routes traffic to Services via spec.rules.http.paths.backend.service.name, establishing a direct reference.
Ingress --> Secret: Valid. Ingress references Secrets via spec.tls.secretName for TLS termination.
Ingress --> IngressClass: Valid. Ingress specifies spec.ingressClassName to bind to an IngressClass resource.

Unrelated Resources?
No unrelated resources were introduced. All listed resources (Service, Secret, IngressClass) are directly referenced in the Ingress manifest’s spec, aligning with the examples (e.g., ClusterRoleBinding→ClusterRole).

Conclusion: The answer complies with the initial definitions.
Pass

Prompt: The verbs supported by ingresses resource include: [Create Delete DeleteCollection Get List Update Watch Patch] 
please make the API resource permission reference analysis based on the results of the API resource reference analysis. Just list the final results of permission reference, such as 'verb1 ingresses --> verb2 otherRes', without explanation.

Answer: 
Thinking...
Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants the API resource permission reference analysis for Ingresses based on the previous resource references (Ingress → Service, Secret, IngressClass). They provided the supported verbs for Ingress: Create, Delete, DeleteCollection, Get, List, Update, Watch, Patch.

First, I need to determine how actions on Ingresses (using these verbs) might trigger permissions on the referenced resources (Service, Secret, IngressClass).

Looking at the examples from earlier:

Creating a Deployment requires create Pod permissions because the controller creates Pods.
Updating a Node's taints might require delete Pod permissions because it can evict Pods.
Creating a ClusterRoleBinding grants the permissions of the referenced ClusterRole.

For Ingress:

Create Ingress: When you create an Ingress, the Ingress controller might interact with the referenced Service, Secret, and IngressClass. However, the user creating the Ingress doesn't directly create these resources; the Ingress just references existing ones. So, does creating an Ingress require permissions on the referenced resources? For example, if the Ingress references a Service named "my-service", does the user need 'get' or 'list' permissions on Services to validate the reference? Or does the Kubernetes API check that automatically without requiring the user to have those permissions? The user might need 'get' access to the referenced Service, Secret, and IngressClass to ensure they exist, but Kubernetes might not enforce this via RBAC. This is a bit ambiguous. However, based on the earlier example with ClusterRoleBinding, creating a ClusterRoleBinding requires permissions on ClusterRole (to reference it), but the example there states that creating a ClusterRoleBinding can grant permissions, hence the 'create ClusterRoleBinding --> * *'.

But in the Ingress case, creating an Ingress that references a Service might not inherently require the user to have permissions on that Service, unless the API server validates the existence of the Service. If the API server does check, the user would need 'get' permission on the referenced Service, Secret, and IngressClass. However, according to Kubernetes' behavior, when you create an Ingress, the API server checks if the referenced Services exist. If they don't, the Ingress is still created, but the Ingress controller will not route traffic. So maybe the API server doesn't enforce existence checks, meaning the user doesn't need permissions on the referenced resources. But in terms of security, if a user can reference any Service, they might expose internal Services they shouldn't access. However, in RBAC terms, the permission to create an Ingress doesn't inherently grant access to the referenced resources unless the user also has permissions on those resources.

But according to the initial examples, the permission reference analysis links actions on one resource to required permissions on another. For example, creating a Deployment requires create Pod because the Deployment controller will create Pods. Similarly, creating an Ingress might require permissions on the referenced resources if the API server enforces their existence. But if the API server doesn't check, then the user doesn't need those permissions. However, in practice, the user might need 'get' permissions on the referenced Services, Secrets, and IngressClasses to successfully create an Ingress that references them, depending on the admission controllers in place.

But the examples provided by the user earlier, for instance, the ClusterRoleBinding example, creating a ClusterRoleBinding that references a ClusterRole doesn't require the user to have permissions on the ClusterRole, but the permission reference is still listed as 'create ClusterRoleBinding --> * *' because it can bind to a high-privileged role. So maybe the logic here is that by creating an Ingress, the user can influence how traffic is routed to Services they might not own, but that's more about indirect access rather than direct permissions. However, the permission reference analysis as per the user's examples seems to focus on direct permissions required due to the resource's operation.

Alternatively, maybe the permission references are that certain verbs on Ingress could lead to the need for certain verbs on referenced resources. For example, creating an Ingress might require the user to have 'get' permissions on the referenced Service, Secret, and IngressClass to validate they exist. But if the API server doesn't enforce that, then maybe no permissions are needed. However, in the case of Secrets, when an Ingress references a Secret for TLS, the Secret must exist in the same namespace, and the user might need 'get' access to that Secret. But again, Kubernetes allows creating the Ingress even if the Secret doesn't exist, but the Ingress controller will fail to configure TLS until the Secret is present.

Given the ambiguity, following the user's examples, perhaps the permission references would be:

create/update/patch Ingress requires 'get' on Services, Secrets, and IngressClasses (if the API server checks existence)
But the user's examples like Deployment --> Pod show that creating a Deployment requires create Pod permissions because the controller creates Pods. For Ingress, since the Ingress doesn't create Services, Secrets, or IngressClasses, but references them, maybe the permission required is 'get' on those resources.

But in the initial examples, the permission references were about the action triggering another action. For example, create Deployment requires create Pod. For Ingress, creating an Ingress doesn't create a Service, but references it. So maybe the permission required is 'get' on Service, 'get' on Secret, and 'get' on IngressClass. But the user's examples didn't include such cases. The ClusterRoleBinding example was about binding to a role, which grants permissions, but the permission reference there was create ClusterRoleBinding --> * * (all permissions), which is a bit different.

Alternatively, if a user can create an Ingress that references a Secret they don't have access to, they might cause the Ingress controller to use that Secret, potentially leading to information disclosure. But in terms of Kubernetes RBAC, the user would need 'get' permissions on the Secret to reference it. If they don't have 'get', the API server might reject the Ingress creation if it checks for the Secret's existence. However, by default, I think the API server doesn't check, so the Ingress is created, but the controller can't access the Secret if it's in a different namespace or the user doesn't have access. So maybe the permission reference here is that the user needs 'get' on the referenced resources to successfully create an Ingress that uses them. Therefore:

create ingress --> get service
create ingress --> get secret
create ingress --> get ingressclass

Similarly, updating or patching the Ingress to change these references would require the same.

But the user's previous examples didn't include 'get' permissions. For example, creating a Deployment requires 'create' on Pods, not 'get'. So perhaps the correct approach here is that since Ingress references other resources but doesn't create/update them, there is no direct permission reference. However, the user's example with ClusterRoleBinding shows that creating a binding can grant permissions, hence the wildcard.

Alternatively, if the Ingress controller needs to read the referenced resources (like Services, Secrets), the user might not need permissions on them because the controller runs with its own privileges. But the user creating the Ingress would need permissions to reference them. However, in Kubernetes, referencing a resource in a manifest doesn't require the user to have permissions on that resource. For example, a user can create a Pod that mounts a Secret they don't have access to, and the Pod will fail to start, but the API allows the creation. Therefore, the user doesn't need 'get' on the Secret to reference it in a Pod spec. Similarly, for Ingress, the user can reference a Service they don't have access to, and the Ingress will be created, but the controller may not configure it correctly.

Thus, according to Kubernetes' default behavior, the user doesn't need permissions on the referenced resources (Service, Secret, IngressClass) to create an Ingress that references them. Therefore, there might be no direct permission references here. However, if the cluster has admission controllers that enforce existence checks, then the user would need 'get' permissions. But since the user's initial examples didn't consider admission controllers, perhaps the answer is that there are no permission references for Ingress to the referenced resources. But this contradicts the ClusterRoleBinding example, where creating a binding can grant permissions even if the user doesn't have access to the ClusterRole.

Alternatively, maybe the permission reference is that creating an Ingress allows routing traffic to a Service, which could be considered an indirect permission, but in terms of Kubernetes RBAC, it's not a direct permission trigger.

Given the ambiguity and the examples provided earlier, the safest approach is to follow the pattern where referencing a resource doesn't inherently require permissions on it unless the resource is managed/created by the action. Since Ingress doesn't create Services, Secrets, or IngressClasses, but references existing ones, there might be no permission references. Therefore, the answer would be no permission references. However, this contradicts the earlier example where ClusterRoleBinding references ClusterRole but the permission reference is create ClusterRoleBinding --> * *.

Wait, in the ClusterRoleBinding example, the permission reference is derived because the binding grants the permissions of the ClusterRole to the subject. So creating a binding effectively allows the subject to have those permissions. Hence, the permission reference is about the consequence of the action, not the permissions required to perform the action. However, in the user's initial examples, the permission reference analysis was about the permissions required to perform the action, not the permissions granted. For example, creating a Deployment requires create Pod because the Deployment controller will create Pods, so the user needs create Pod permissions. Similarly, modifying a Node's taints requires delete Pod because it may evict Pods.

In that case, for Ingress, since the Ingress doesn't create Services, Secrets, or IngressClasses, the user doesn't need permissions on those resources to create/update the Ingress. Therefore, there are no permission references. But the example with ClusterRoleBinding seems different because it's about the permissions granted, not required. So perhaps the Ingress doesn't have any permission references.

But the user's answer for ClusterRoleBinding was create ClusterRoleBinding --> * *, which is about the consequence (binding to a powerful role), not the required permissions. The user creating the ClusterRoleBinding needs permissions to create ClusterRoleBindings and reference the ClusterRole, but the permission reference is about the resulting permissions granted, not the ones required. This is a bit inconsistent.

Given this confusion, perhaps the correct answer based on the user's examples is that there are no permission references for Ingress, as the Ingress does not create or modify the referenced resources (Service, Secret, IngressClass), only references them. Therefore, the verbs on Ingress do not trigger any permissions on other resources.

But wait, when you create an Ingress, the Ingress controller might create other resources like LoadBalancers (in cloud providers), but those are outside the core Kubernetes resources. The user is focusing on core API resources. Therefore, the final answer is that there are no permission references for Ingress actions to other resources.
create ingresses --> get service
