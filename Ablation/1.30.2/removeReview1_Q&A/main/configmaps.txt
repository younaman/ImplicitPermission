Prompt: As a Kubernetes expert, specializing in identifying API Resource Reference Analysis and API Resource Permission Reference Analysis. Your task is to make the following two analyses of kubernetes api resources provided by users: 1. API Resource Reference Analysis: Analyze dependencies, interactions, and relationships among Kubernetes API resources. 2.API Resource Permission Reference Analysis: Analyze the influence relationship between permissions, that is, one permission may trigger another permission.
    Regarding the API resource reference analysis, it is defined as follows: In the context of Kubernetes, API resource reference analysis can be understood as analyzing the dependencies and interactions among API resources within Kubernetes. Below are some examples:
    1. For the Deployment resource, its Spec.PodTemplate field determines the state of the Pod resources it manages. Modifying the content of this field will also cause corresponding changes in the associated Pods. Therefore, this is an example of resource reference: Deployment --> Pod.
    2. For the Node resource, its Spec.Taints field is related to the scheduling of Pod resources. The values of the Taint field affect the creation and deletion of Pod resources. Therefore, this is an example of resource reference: Node --> Pod.
    3. For the Daemonset resource, its Spec.Template field determines the state of the Pods it manages. Therefore, it can be considered a resource reference: Daemonset --> Pod.
    4. For the StatefulSet resource, its Spec.Template field determines the state of the Pod resources it manages. Modifying the content of this field will also cause corresponding changes in the associated Pods. Therefore, this is an example of resource reference: StatefulSet --> Pod.
    5. For the Job resource, its Spec.Template field determines the state of the Pods it manages. Therefore, this is an example of resource reference: Job --> Pod.
    6. For the ClusterRoleBinding resource, it can associate a ServiceAccount with a ClusterRole, thus creating a reference from ClusterRoleBinding to ClusterRole.
    Regarding the API resource permission reference analysis, it is defined as follows: Based on API resource reference analysis, the analysis incorporates the resource's verb to further examine the feasibility of the reference as well as the specific content and functionality of the reference. Below are some examples:
    1. For example 1 in the above resource reference, the permission reference analysis is as follows: Creating a Deployment resource can control the creation of Pod resources. From this, we can derive the permission reference: create Deployment --> create Pod, etc.
    2. For example 2 in the above resource reference, the permission reference analysis is as follows: Modifying the taint field of a Node resource can trigger the deletion of some specific Pods. From this, we can derive the permission reference: patch Node --> delete Pod, update Node --> delete Pod, etc.
    3. For example 3 in the above resource reference, the permission reference analysis is as follows: Deleting Daemonset can lead to the deletion of corresponding Pod resources. From this, we can derive the permission reference: delete Daemonset --> delete Pod, deletecollection Daemonset --> delete Pod, etc.
    4. For example 4 in the above resource reference, the permission reference analysis is as follows: Modifying the spec.template of StatefulSet resources can result in Modifying corresponding Pod resources, and modifying the spec.replicas of StatefulSet can result in creation and deletion the corresponding pod. From this, we can derive the permission reference: patch StatefulSet --> patch Pod, patch StatefulSet --> create Pod, patch StatefulSet --> delete Pod, update StatefulSet --> update Pod, etc.
    5. For example 5 in the above resource reference, the permission reference analysis is as follows: Creating a Job resource can control the creation of Pod resources. From this, we can derive the permission reference: create Job --> create Pod, etc.
    6. For example 6 in the above resource reference, the permission reference analysis is as follows: Creating a ClusterRoleBinding can bind a ClusterRole to a ServiceAccount. The cluster by default has the cluster-admin ClusterRole, which possesses all permissions. Therefore, the following permission reference can be derived: create ClusterRoleBinding --> * *.
    Do you understand the above two concepts, and are you ready to start the analysis? Answer yes or no.

Answer: 
Yes.

Prompt: Please make the API resource reference analysis of configmaps. Just list the final results such as 'configmaps --> otherRes', without explanation.

Answer: 
Here is the API resource reference analysis result for ConfigMaps:
ConfigMap --> Pod
ConfigMap --> Deployment
ConfigMap --> StatefulSet
ConfigMap --> DaemonSet
ConfigMap --> Job
ConfigMap --> CronJob
ConfigMap --> ReplicaSet
ConfigMap --> ReplicationController
ConfigMap --> Volume (via Pod)
ConfigMap --> Environment Variables (via Pod)
ConfigMap --> CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) (when CRDs reference configmaps)

Prompt: The verbs supported by configmaps resource include: [Create Delete DeleteCollection Get List Update Watch Patch] 
    please make the API resource permission reference analysis based on the results of the API resource reference analysis. Just list the final results of permission reference, such as 'verb1 configmaps --> verb2 otherRes', without explanation.

Answer: 
Here is the API resource permission reference analysis result for ConfigMaps:
create configmaps --> create Pod
update configmaps --> update Pod
patch configmaps --> patch Pod
delete configmaps --> delete Pod
deletecollection configmaps --> delete Pod
create configmaps --> create Deployment
update configmaps --> update Deployment
patch configmaps --> patch Deployment
delete configmaps --> delete Deployment
deletecollection configmaps --> delete Deployment
create configmaps --> create StatefulSet
update configmaps --> update StatefulSet
patch configmaps --> patch StatefulSet
delete configmaps --> delete StatefulSet
deletecollection configmaps --> delete StatefulSet
create configmaps --> create DaemonSet
update configmaps --> update DaemonSet
patch configmaps --> patch DaemonSet
delete configmaps --> delete DaemonSet
deletecollection configmaps --> delete DaemonSet
create configmaps --> create Job
update configmaps --> update Job
patch configmaps --> patch Job
delete configmaps --> delete Job
deletecollection configmaps --> delete Job
create configmaps --> create CronJob
update configmaps --> update CronJob
patch configmaps --> patch CronJob
delete configmaps --> delete CronJob
deletecollection configmaps --> delete CronJob
create configmaps --> create ReplicaSet
update configmaps --> update ReplicaSet
patch configmaps --> patch ReplicaSet
delete configmaps --> delete ReplicaSet
deletecollection configmaps --> delete ReplicaSet
create configmaps --> create ReplicationController
update configmaps --> update ReplicationController
patch configmaps --> patch ReplicationController
delete configmaps --> delete ReplicationController
deletecollection configmaps --> delete ReplicationController
create configmaps --> create CustomResourceDefinition
update configmaps --> update CustomResourceDefinition
patch configmaps --> patch CustomResourceDefinition
delete configmaps --> delete CustomResourceDefinition
deletecollection configmaps --> delete CustomResourceDefinition

Prompt: Review your answer against the initial definitions:
1. Did you avoid introducing unrelated permission references?
Answer "Pass" if compliant, or "Fail: [reason]" if not.
If the answer is fail, please correct the result.

Answer: 
Fail: The previous answer incorrectly introduced permission references from configmaps to higher-level resources like Deployment, StatefulSet, DaemonSet, Job, CronJob, ReplicaSet, ReplicationController, and CustomResourceDefinition. According to the initial definitions, permission references should reflect direct Kubernetes behaviorâ€”ConfigMaps do not directly trigger creation, update, patch, or deletion of higher-level resources. Rather, modifying ConfigMaps directly impacts Pods (through environment variables or mounted volumes). Higher-level resources manage Pods independently, and their reference to ConfigMaps is indirect and passive, meaning updating ConfigMaps does not directly trigger operations on those higher-level resources.
Corrected permission reference analysis result:
create configmaps --> create Pod
update configmaps --> update Pod
patch configmaps --> patch Pod
delete configmaps --> delete Pod
deletecollection configmaps --> delete Pod
